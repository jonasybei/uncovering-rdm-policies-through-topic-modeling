The purpose of this policy is to establish a set of principles to govern the management of data arising from the research activities of the University (‚ÄúResearch Data‚Äù1). This policy is intended to cover active Research Data sets that are of potential current or future interest or value to the field. It will not apply where there are legitimate legal, ethical and/or commercial constraints on data use.

The University recognises that there is an increased requirement from funders to manage, share and provide open access to Research Data, and acknowledges that the wider benefits of this approach can include additional public interest and funding, increased validation of results, efficiencies through data re- use and novel use of existing data.

For clarity, this policy applies to all Research Data, regardless of whether the research is externally funded or subject to funder mandates. This policy applies to all staff that are authorized to use the University‚Äôs name and services in the course of their research, including post graduate students and visiting, honorary and emeritus staff.

The University of East Anglia recognises Research Data as a valuable institutional asset to be managed in line with UKRI Common Principles on Research Data (  In addition, the University acknowledges the role that good Research Data management can play in supporting the University‚Äôs research vision to ensure that our research has the highest possible global influence through a dissemination strategy that maximises impact and that ensures effective communication of our research.

The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that Researchers and support staff:

are supported in good Research Data management practice.
find it easier to conduct research relying on Research Data.
benefit from improved citations of their work.
can maximise impact of their research by encouraging discoverability and re-use.
have a reduced likelihood of data loss through inaccessibility and corruption.
can comply with legislation and the policies and requirements of research funders and of Third Party Data providers.

POLICY ADOPTED BY ACADEMIC BOARD ON 27TH FEB. 2019

## Introduction

This policy applies to all research, funded or unfunded, created by UEL academics and research postgraduate students. It applies to all disciplines, including those in the arts and creative areas.

The University of East London (UEL) recognises that quality research demands effective data management in the support of academic integrity, openness, and good information governance. UEL will ensure that research data is managed to high standards throughout the research data lifecycle i as part of its commitment to academic excellence. This policy will ensure that UEL acts in accordance with UK Research and Innovation's Common principles on data policy ii , requirements of funding bodies, and general best practice.

It should be viewed in conjunction with the Code of Practice for Research Ethics, the Policy on Intellectual Property, the Data Storage & Retention Policy, and the Open Access Policy.

## Definition

Research data is defined as information or material captured or created during the course of research, and which underpins, tests, or validates the content of the final research output. The nature of it can vary greatly according to discipline. It is often empirical or statistical, but also includes material such as drafts or prototypes that underpin creative or 'non-traditional' outputs. Research data is often digital, but includes a wide range of paper-based and other physical objects. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:

Statistical data held in spreadsheets or databases
Test, survey or questionnaire responses
Interview transcripts
Notebooks and fieldbooks
Laboratory test results
Prototypes
Audio and video recordings
Photographs
Specimens or samples
Artefacts
Algorithms and scripts
Drafts or earlier versions of creative outputs, such as works of art or musical
compositions

The University of Greenwich is committed to expanding the total proportion of our research and scholarship outputs, and their underlying research data, that are published in open access (OA) forms.

The university is committed to enabling its active researchers to share the results of research through a range of open means in order to maximize research impact within the academic research community and across society more broadly. The university also supports the use of research identifiers for all researchers, such as ORCID; it is currently mandatory for anyone on a research career pathway to obtain and use their ORCID.

This statement and the policies that follow support the activities of many key research funders that now make the OA publication of outputs and data a condition of funding. This includes Research England, which requires articles and conference papers accepted for publication to be available in an appropriate open access format in order to be eligible for the Research Excellence Framework (REF).

The following policies apply to all staff and any postgraduate students actively engaged in research activity:"""^^xsd:string .

pt:Chunk_104_1 a ns1:chunk ;
    pt:describes pt:Topic_-1 ;
    ns1:text """Publications Policy

There are two main routes to OA for publications, known as Gold and Green. The university holds a general preference to follow the Green route for publications by depositing appropriate copies into a recognised OA repository. Consequently, all staff and postgraduate students must make a record in the University of Greenwich Academic Literature Archive (GALA) for all published research outputs. For articles and conference proceedings (with an ISSN), an accepted manuscript must be uploaded to GALA within three months of acceptance, and the embargo period must not exceed a 12 month maxima (Panels A & B) or a 24 month maxima (Panels C & D1.)

Where researchers use the Gold route to OA, whether in a gratis OA journal, through the university‚Äôs participation in a Transformative Agreement with a publisher, or supported by project funds, a record of the output must still be added to GALA.

Where an author is licensing their research outputs and publications under an open or Creative Commons licence, the university takes a scholar-led approach. As such, the licensing decision is the responsibility of the individual researcher, unless they are in an agreement with a research funder or other associated external organisation that frequently mandate the use of specific open licences.

In order to optimise the potential impact of research outputs, this policy strongly recommends the most open licence available in order to help maximise impact potential and allow the university to actively contribute to the construction of the scholarly commons. Where institutional funds are involved in the access to an opportunity to openly license an output, such as through participation in a Transformative Agreement, open licensing opportunities should be agreed with Research Development Services.

In support of this policy, the university commits to support and train academic and research staff in understanding OA and the Research England policy for REF, as well as choosing journals and licences that allow outputs to be compliant with institutional external policies and mandates.

The university also commits to maintaining GALA, optimising it for emerging publication types and supporting its ongoing use with training and online materials.

GALA forms an institutional record of the research and scholarship published by the university's research community, helping to protect and preserve the scholarly record. Records are anticipated to be kept permanently, but where appropriate, the Takedown Policy exists to fairly handle the removal of any records as required."""^^xsd:string .

The social standing of academic inquiry and of universities in general will only be maintained and enhanced if all research is done in an appropriate and ethical manner, including protecting the confidentiality of personal information, while at the same time enabling peer review and verification of data.

To protect people during research, especially vulnerable people, means supporting good practices that deal with data management and ethical aspects.

This document outlines the general policy relating to Research Data Management (RDM) in the Faculty of Spatial Sciences, and it lays out what is expected of staff and PhD students based in the Faculty. The document links to and needs to be read alongside other documents such as the policies on research ethics. For the learning environment of bachelor and master students a ‚Äòlight‚Äô version of this data management policy is applicable, while learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme.

This document is updated regularly and aligned with the central RUG research portal (  and follows a range of procedures and protocols that have been implemented at European, Dutch and University levels. Of particular note is the legal requirement of the university to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It is therefore important that staff and PhD researchers are aware of and comply with this policy and the requirements and general expectations it discusses.

The Faculty‚Äôs overall position is one that accepts that its academic staff and PhDs are professional and competent, but acknowledges that it is the Faculty‚Äôs legal and social responsibility to provide appropriate oversight and monitoring in an efficient way."""^^xsd:string .

In planning research and the methodology to be used, it is important to consider the ethical as well as practical implications of how the research is to be conducted and data collected and managed, especially the requirement to anonymise the data as soon as practical. Awareness of the requirements should influence the design of the methodology. The planning of the research must include the need to consider ethical issues and the requirements relating to data management.

Data is to be collected in an ethically responsible way. During the data collection process, there needs to be security of data already collected. For example, questionnaires should be securely stored. Audio or video recordings should be transferred to a password protected device as soon as possible. Initially data is likely to be re-identifiable, with the identification kept separate to actual data; however, it should be anonymised as soon as practical. Ideally, data is stored directly onto the Y: drive.

During field work, data can be stored initially on a personal computer or laptop if there is no internet possibility. The data will need to be uploaded onto the Y-drive regularly (depending on the circumstances). It is recommended to also upload on an encrypted external hard-drive and then delete data from the laptop. It is also good practice to encrypt the partition of the harddrive reserved for storing personal data. In case of loss or stolen laptop/devices this needs to be reported as a data breach via cert@security.rug.nl."""^^xsd:string .

In line with the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Scientific Practice and the policies of the University of Groningen, empirical data is required to be stored safely. In anticipation of a RUG wide repository, the Faculty manages a Research Data Repository (Y-drive). The FSS repository is in a digital form where every researcher has their own folder identified with a P-number. Researchers will be required to provide their data in an appropriate form (including anonymization). The function of the Faculty repository is to enable access only under certain specific circumstances relating to the need to be able to verify the data. The URSI Director in consultation with the researcher will be responsible for assessing any request to access data in the repository. Consistent with the prevailing requirements, data will be stored in this repository for a fixed period of 10 years. After 10 years, data that has not been made open access will be destroyed, though if needed data can be stored longer. Note that all data must be fully anonymised as soon as practical to do so.

Note that the Faculty data repository is not an open access facility, it is merely established to allow scrutiny in relation to legitimate concerns about scientific integrity. To comply with the open access expectation, researchers might need to identify an appropriate open access data provider, such as might be provided by a scientific institute or a journal publisher."""^^xsd:string .

‚ÄòOwnership‚Äô is a word with legal implications, and strictly speaking the ownership status of data is complicated by the employment status of the researcher as well as of any grant funding received. Nevertheless, irrespective of the formal ownership of data, all researchers have a responsibility for care of data; and the University of Groningen has a responsibility relating to any research done under its auspices. Therefore, unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary, responsibility for data management relating to the data from a specific research project will be regarded as the responsibility of the principal investigator or  PhD team (PhD student and supervisors), indicated in the RDM Plan submitted for that project.

Responsibility for data in cases when the researcher leaves the University In the case of a PhD researcher finishing their PhD or a staff member leaving to go to another institution, for all completed projects, it is expected that all (anonymised) data will be deposited in the Faculty Research Data Repository in an appropriate form, accessible by the researcher and supervisor(s). For ongoing projects that are to remain at the University of Groningen, an alternative principle investigator is to be nominated.

Responsibility for data when a researcher joins the University transferring a project In the case of a finished project, it will normally be expected that the previous institution will manage the data storage provisions into the future. In cases where a staff member transfers a project, the Faculty will accept responsibility for the project and future data storage responsibility.

Ownership and responsibility of data when cooperating with other
organizations/institutions
This will be decided on a case by case basis, but for each project there must be a clear determination about which institution will be responsible for management of data and compliance with the requirements of the European General Data Protection

    ns1:text """(1) The General Data Protection Regulation

Since May 2018, all member states of the European Economic Area share the same data protection law: the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This law governs the processing of personal data both inside and outside the EU/EEA when this is done by organisations based in one of the member states. This law also applies to research activities by universities, even when these take place in non-member states.

Personal data in the GDPR are defined as ‚Äúany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person‚Äù (Art. 4.1).  A ‚Äònatural‚Äô person means a living person. In the GDPR, there is no distinction between public and private/confidential data, only between personal and non-personal data. All personal data should be treated as confidential.

In case of secondary data, the researcher should check if consent is needed from the secondary data source. Also when using existing data, it is important that the respondent gave consent for these data to be re-used. (see  

Examples of ‚Äòidentifiers‚Äô are names, an identification number, contact details, location data, dates and times of meetings, IP-addresses, ethnicity, religious identity, or a combination of data that allows for a person to be identified as a unique individual. ‚ÄòProcessing‚Äô should be understood as any operation with data: gathering, viewing, analyzing, storing, sharing etc.

The GDPR sets constraints to what is possible with personal data and requires us to properly secure the data.

We expect staff:

to take notice of the general principles of the GDPR. A special UG website has been created to inform everyone in the UG about the basic principles; to take standard precautions when handling data. Among these are e.g. creating strong passwords, anonymisation when possible, working on secure devices and working on the university‚Äôs network as much as possible. See the UG‚Äôs website for a general overview of the standard measures that you can take; in case of handling personal data in research to be demonstrably compliant, by creating and registering a data management plan and applying for approval of the Research Ethics Committee and by checking whether a DPIA is necessary."""^^xsd:string .

A central principle in the GDPR is ‚Äòaccountability‚Äô. If researchers are planning to process personal data in their research, then they need to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR. This means that researchers are expected to design their research in such a way that the private lives of participants as well as their rights and freedoms are minimally impacted, and that researchers can show how this will be achieved.

Researchers are therefore expected to anonymise data when possible, design their research in a privacy-friendly way, think about appropriate technical and organizational measures, register their research proposal and follow the existing ethics approval procedure."""^^xsd:string .

Apart from a research data management plan, research involving living human beings may also require doing a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).

A full DPIA report:

maps the data privacy risks in the project;
assesses these risks; and
defines protection measures to eliminate or mitigate the risks.

Performing a DPIA is legally required when data processing activities1 are likely to ‚Äòresult in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons‚Äô (art. 35 GDPR).

An exhaustive list of potential high-risk scenario‚Äôs cannot be given in advance, but in general, a DPIA may be necessary when researchers are planning to include sensitive personal data into their dataset (such as health data or ethnicity); when they involve innovative technologies (and companies) that process data; research with location data, GPS tracking of individuals or research that uses ‚Äòprofiling techniques‚Äô; when people may be in a vulnerable position (children, or people  who face imbalances in power relationships; or when they systematic monitor of publicly accessible areas without informing people (‚Äòcovert observation‚Äô). Projects that involve many different partners with different (non-academic) aims  may also be subjected to a DPIA.

If a DPIA is required, then this should take place before data processing starts. A DPIA can be supported by the Digital Competence Center and performed by a team of people involved in the project in question, including, for example, a subject expert, a privacy officer, an IT expert, and a student or staff member involved. The process may be timeconsuming. Researchers are therefore advised to contact the DCC as soon as possible (see section 20 on support).

If a DPIA has already been performed on a similar research project at our, or at a different research university in the EU/EEA zone, then this can also be used as a point of reference, provided that the data protection measures set out are demonstrably applied by the researcher.

The Privacy and Security Coordinator can advise whether a DPIA is necessary. The decision to do a DPIA is ultimately the responsibility of the Faculty Board."""^^xsd:string .

Their research activities therefore fall under the responsibility of the Faculty if the research activities are part of compulsory course units under supervision of a staff member, i.e. a bachelor and master thesis or a publishable journal article.  As data management is a learning process like others, making mistakes is part of this process. Teaching students how to learn and improve skills on data management is part of the educational programme (for example in the course Methods of Academic Research).

In terms of data management/GDPR/ethics, actions are restricted to the following educational activities, and only in case:

students are collecting primary data (personal data) themselves for compulsory course units of the degree programmes for the Bachelor‚Äôs and /or Master‚Äôs thesis.
the results of research are published, not only in journals but also for example in conference papers.

These actions are:

Students make a data management plan as part of the Bachelor‚Äôs or Master‚Äôs Thesis process if it includes personal data (for example retrieved via interviews). This also includes a dedicated paragraph in the written thesis.
The student should follow instructions to handle data in a correct way (checked by the supervisor), storing the data in a secure place, protected by  two-factor authentication, adhering to good practice.
The Faculty and the CIT are responsible for offering the student a secure storage space. This will be the Y-drive by default, unless the project requires otherwise (to be determined case by case).
Students and/or their supervisor should register the project in a suitable format once the RUG Research Gateway is in place.

One of the University‚Äôs policy goals is to make, in principle, all data FAIR. Below, the general requirements that the data (and software and scripts) must meet at the UG are integrated into the presently accepted terminology of the FAIR principles. The data are:

### Findable:

Data is sustainably stored and curated;
Data is provided with metadata, including affiliation and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;
Data is registered on the basis of metadata in the research database of the university.

### Accessible:

Data is accurate, complete, reliable, authentic and provided with metadata and, if possible, with a persistent identifier;
Data is available for checking and further research after completion of the research and/or the departure of the researcher;
Data is openly available, unless valid reasons prevent this.

Interoperable:

Data is stored in sustainable file formats;
The discipline specific standards for the enrichment of data are applied;
Data (and metadata) is provided with references to other relevant material.

### Reusable:

The origin of the data and the affiliation of the researcher involved is clear (Provenance);
The discipline specific standards for data management are applied; The conditions for reuse are clearly described.

Furthermore, open science and FAIR principles need to be integrated in the data process as much as possible. This policy is based on a ‚Äúcomply or explain‚Äù principle, meaning that exceptions to this policy are possible. A researcher may wish not to make the data publicly available when:

1) Making the data publicly available would contradict any agreement or undertaken given as part of the informed consent process.
2) Where public release might have negative consequences for the people researched.
3) When there is an obligation or objective to protect results so that they can commercially or industrially exploited (or reasonably expected to be exploited).
4) Where public release could represent a security concern.
5) If open access would jeopardize achievement of the main aim of the research.
6) If there is any other legitimate reason not to publish the data.

This policy is informed by several key overarching principles that govern research at the University of Groningen and at universities in general:

All research is to be undertaken in an ethical and legally responsible manner, paying due respect to all participants in the research process, and in accordance with relevant legislation. Although there are many aspects to ethical research, the concept of informed consent is fundamental. Essentially, all research participants should be fully informed about all aspects of the research, including plans for the storage of data, and their informed consent has been obtained before their data is collected. With regard to research ethics policies and standard academic integrity we refer here to the RUG policy which is based on the Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity 2018.
  Research also applies to student research, carried out in the context of a bachelor or master thesis or the writing of an article. Learning skills on data management is part of the educational programme. This is elaborated upon in section 11.
When personal data are processed in research, then these must be handled in a way that meets the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In particular, this entails the requirement to demonstrate that appropriate
technical and organizational measures to achieve privacy by design are in place. When possible, data needs to be anonymised.
Research methodologies, experimental design, data, data analysis, statistics, results and interpretations should be subject to peer review and scrutiny, and all researchers should be able to substantiate their choices, and be able to provide access for validation of the integrity of the data.
Where research is publicly funded, the results of the research should be made publicly accessible, either through the provision of open access publications or by making short summaries available.
Where feasible and ethically appropriate, researchers will make their data FAIR (see section 12)."""^^xsd:string .

Research data are central to science and research. The production of data requires long-term efforts as well as technical and financial resources. In fact, the reusability of research data has become an increasingly important question in terms both of science and research, and of the impact of research.

For the University of Helsinki as well as its units and researchers, research data constitute a strategic resource and an international competitive factor. The goal of the University is to promote responsible research data management, which is of crucial significance for the findability, accessibility and reuse of research-based knowledge (for the definition of ‚Äòresearch data‚Äô and ‚Äòresearch data management‚Äô, see the glossary).

The principles of open science and open research data play a prominent role in the strategic plan of the University of Helsinki for 2021‚Äì2030. The University‚Äôs strategic goals include open research infrastructures and open research data, the implementation of the FAIR Principles in research data management, and the advancement of competencies in the analysis of large and open datasets.

A key goal of the research data policy is to guide everyone involved in research data management to familiarise themselves with current data management requirements as well as to adopt good and responsible practices as part of everyday research activities. Another goal is to make research data management increasingly clear for individual researchers.

From an organisational perspective, the research data policy describes the goals that guide the development of research data services at the University of Helsinki. The goal is for University of Helsinki researchers to have at their disposal infrastructures and services that enable responsible research data management, developed in an economically sustainable manner while taking researchers‚Äô needs into account.

In terms of its fundamental goals, the new research data policy of the University of Helsinki does not significantly differ from the previous policy published in 2015. The new policy has been amended to comply with current legislation as well as national and international guidelines and recommendations. In contrast to the previous policy, whose more limited scope only encompassed digital data, the new research data policy applies to all research data and related management principles. Another important change is the further clarification and highlighting of responsibilities."""^^xsd:string .

This research data policy covers all research conducted at the University of Helsinki, as well as the research data collected and produced in conjunction with it. This denotes both digital data as well as physical and analogue data, which are all referred to as research data in the research data policy (for the definition of ‚Äòresearch data‚Äô, see the glossary).

The research data policy applies to all members of the University community involved in research, including University employees and students as well as those who conduct research on behalf of the University.

1.2 Other policies pertaining to research data management at the University of Helsinki

The principles and goals presented in the research data policy supplement other University of Helsinki policies relevant to the management of research data, including the principles of open science, the data protection principles, the information security policy and the guidelines of the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity for the responsible conduct of research. The research data policy is also in line with the University‚Äôs data management practices and principles.

Policies related to research data management at the University of Helsinki are guided primarily by EU and Finnish law. By employing policies and guidelines, the University strives to ensure the legality of research activities. In international research and other cooperation, research data management can also be regulated by legislation outside the European Union.

External research funders and partners may also have specific requirements for research data management.

The general objectives for the processing of data stored in University of Helsinki research infrastructures or those on the national or international level are described in the University of Helsinki Research Infrastructure Programme (for the definition of ‚Äòresearch infrastructure‚Äô, see the glossary). In addition, national and international research infrastructures may have their own jointly agreed policies for the processing of the data that they produce.

1.1.1 The University of Huddersfield‚Äôs academic community produces large volumes of research data, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Open Data and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, as well as maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research.

1.1.2 The University of Huddersfield supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI general policies and guidance on research data which encourage members of the UK research community to make openly available research data they have gathered and generated.  The University is committed to reviewing new initiatives in this area as they arise and supporting them as deemed appropriate.

1.1.3 The University of Huddersfield also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements.

This policy aims to establish the measures needed to facilitate the appropriate curation and management of data, to secure its longevity and its potential to be shared.

1.2.2 This policy is intended to help promote good practice around research data, with the particular aim that it is:

stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility; appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed; an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected;
kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including the Data Protection Act 2018 / The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2018 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies;

The purpose of this policy is to establish principles for effective management of the research data generated within the University plus its dissemination. The policy provides the link between research practice and the data it produces, the management and curation of research data, including legal criteria that need attention, sharing research data with others, and the responsibilities that stakeholders in the research process have to ensure success in working with research data.

## Scope:

This policy applies to all research carried out at the University of Hull, whether conducted by staff or students, funded externally or by the University (respecting where contracts with private funders may have specific requirements). The policy does not apply to data gathered through regular business and administrative activity of the University, although it is recognised that the principles and practice detailed in this and related documents may also be of benefit in ensuring effective management of data in those areas

University of Lincoln: Research Data Management Policy

## Research Data Management Policy

Version 2.0

Date: 25 May 2018

The purpose of this policy is to set out the University's expectations for the management and curation of research data across all academic disciplines and in all forms. The University recognises the value of sharing research data openly where appropriate as a way to promote scholarly discourse and support learning and teaching and therefore aspires to be a leader in open data practices.

This policy is applicable to all staff and students and should be read in conjunction with the University's Code of Practice for Research, which reflects the principles and commitments outlined in the Concordat to Support Research Integrity, the University‚Äôs Open access publications policy and Research Ethics Policy.

The University of Lincoln recognises that the curation and sharing of research data is key to its mission to develop and create knowledge. This brings benefits to the University, its members and the public through greater opportunities for access and re-use. Research data is defined as data acquired or generated in the course of research undertaken at the University and its management refers to storage, preservation, discovery, and provision for access and re-use.

The University recognises and supports the UK Research & Innovation Common Principles1 on Data Policy mandates as best practice for data curation and sharing.

This policy aims to address the requirements of researchers, the public, funding and statutory bodies and commercial partners and set out the principles to ensure that research data will be managed, curated and shared to the highest standards throughout the research data lifecycle."""^^xsd:string .

1.1 The University of Liverpool recognises that the effective management of research data is an integral part of good research practice. It is essential for data integrity as well as safeguarding and handling data responsibly in accordance with ethical, legal, and regulatory requirements. Good data management underpins research integrity, transparency, and reproducibility by ensuring data associated with research outputs are documented, preserved, and accessible, thereby allowing for the verification of research results.

1.2 Good management also facilitates data sharing which maximises the reuse of research data, the benefits of which include promoting the work of researchers, fostering collaboration, increased resource efficiency, and securing public trust. The University promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies and supports the Concordat on Open Research Data, and UKRI's Common Principles on research data. The University acknowledges there are valid reasons data may not, or cannot, be shared such as where a contract is in place or data are sensitive. The University endorses Horizon Europe's principle that data should be "as open as possible as closed as necessary" and follow FAIR Principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable)."""^^xsd:string .

The definitions of ‚Äúresearch data‚Äù and of ‚Äúaffiliates of the University of Milan‚Äù that are considered for the purposes of this Policy are specified in the attached document N.1.

The University of Milan acknowledges the fundamental importance of research data as valuable scientificresults. Therefore, the University recognizes the relevance of records management for supporting the principles of quality and integrity in scientific research and is committed to pursuing the highest standardsof data collection, storage and preservation.

The University of Milan adheres to the principles of Open Science and in particular it encourages and protects the sharing of scientific publications and data produced by its staff with public funding according to the "as open as possible as closed as necessary" principle.  In particular, the University of Milan encourages the sharing of scientific data according to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) paradigm.

The University of Milan acknowledges that reliable and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of every research project and that they are necessary for the verification of the soundness and reliability of research methods and results as well as for their reproducibility.

The University of Milan recognizes that research data are the heritage of universities once the scientific project that produced them is concluded and represent ‚Äì in the long term as well ‚Äì a precious resource for research, teaching and, in turn, the progression of society."""^^xsd:string .

Research data shall be archived as soon as possible and in any case no later than 30 days after the scientific publications describing them, without prejudice to specific indications by the Departments. The members of the University of Milan shall use software platforms that are suitable and, where required by the nature of the data, compliant with the regulations in force on the protection of personal data, preferably relying on the public archives of reference for the thematic area to which they belong. In particular, they will adhere to the "good practices" in data and metadata sharing promoted by the research infrastructures identified by ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) as "Landmarks" for the various thematic areas and, in general, to compliance with the FAIR principles.

The University of Milan recognises that research data, even at the end of the scientific project that produced them, besides being an asset of the university institution, represent a resource - even in the long term - for research, university teaching and the progress of society. In general, research data must be collected, managed and archived in accordance with the standards in force in a correct, complete and reliable manner, respecting their integrity and documenting as comprehensively as possible the ways in which they were obtained in order to facilitate their reproducibility.

They must be made findable, accessible, interoperable and, where possible, available for subsequent use (FAIR principles).

If no third party rights, legal requirements or property laws prohibit it, research data can receive a freelicense for open use (for instance Creative Commons) granting traceability and credit to the originalsource.

What data will you create?

Data Description: List the kinds of data or major datasets that you expect to create or use, noting its estimated volume/size, content, coverage or scope, and the types of the data (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, survey data, experimental measurements, models, images, audio-visual data, samples, documents, spreadsheets, databases, images, film, digital models, contents of an application, hardcopy records, physical collections or manuscripts, physical samples, or instrumental measurements etc.). Include the raw data arising directly from the research, the reduced data derived from it, and published data. Also, include non-digital data if relevant. Describe the types, volume, and scope of data that will be created and managed in the following terms: quantitative, qualitative, generated from surveys, clinical measurements, interviews, medical records, electronic health records, administrative records, genotypic data, images, tissue samples, etc.

Data volume: It is important to plan for the volume of data you plan to capture, process, and store. Think about the volume of primary and secondary data you will be producing as part of your research. This could be articulated in the anticipated (estimated) number of files you will generate, or the projected storage capacity you expect to require.

Data format: What file formats will you be making use of during your research? Do formats and software enable sharing and long-term validity of data? UKRI and other funders prefer ‚Äúopen‚Äù formats to ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, proprietary formats, whenever possible. Formats should also be considered to preserve the highest standard of data (so, tiff files would be preferable to compressed jpgs for storing images, for example), and for long-term archival use when possible (e.g. PDF/A, rather than generic PDF, is better suited to long-term archiving).

Who will own the copyright and IPR of any data that you will collect or create? Will you create a licence(s) for its use and reuse? If you are planning to use existing data as part of your research, do any copyright or other restrictions determine its use?

Copyright and IPR of new datasets: State who will own the copyright and IPR of any data that you will collect or create, along with the licence(s) for its use and reuse. An agreement concerning intellectual property ownership with a third party, such as a research funder or commercial sponsor may exist. For multi-partner projects, IPR ownership may be worth covering in a formal consortium or collaboration agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, the University of Nottingham asserts its ownership of rights in datasets generated using the institution's facilities.

Copyright and IPR for existing datasets: If you are planning to use existing data as part of your research, you should state the copyright or other restrictions which determine its use. If possible, you should investigate these issues and attempt to gain copyright clearance so that your data can be shared at the end of your project. You should give full and appropriate acknowledgement, via citation, for any existing data that you use.

Data documentation: Highlight what sort of documentation you intend to provide, including what software and processes/protocols will be required to understand, reuse, and validate the datasets. For example, descriptions of data that enable research data to be used by others outside of your own team. This may include documenting the methods used to generate the data, analytical and procedural information, capturing instrument metadata alongside data, documenting provenance of data and their coding, detailed descriptions for variables, records, etc.

Metadata: When depositing data, repositories will usually require descriptive metadata that describes the data in detail: typically, a title, a brief description of the dataset, and the creator(s) of the data. Provide an overview of what metadata you will provide in order to facilitate discoverability and use of the data. There are various metadata standards which can help you to describe your data in a consistent way, and individual data repositories will advise on the relevant standards. You should provide as much information as you are able to. As an example of the kind of information requested, please see our guide for depositing data within the University of Nottingham's data repository.

1.1.1 The University of Oxford takes pride in the wealth of research data which its academic community produces, and wishes to ensure the widest possible access to its world-class research. The value and utility of research outputs increases the more broadly they are available to be considered and used by others, including scholars, businesses and charities around the globe, as well as society in general. Access for everyone in any location to Oxford‚Äôs preserved and shared research data will also help to highlight the excellence of its research. It will attract scholars and students, foster collaboration, and enhance public engagement with research, and maximise the intellectual, social, cultural and economic impact of research.

1.1.2 The University of Oxford also recognises that good practice in data management is key to an efficient and effective research process. It is essential for enabling and safeguarding the longevity and continuing intelligibility of data, and for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with all relevant ethical and legal requirements. Preserving the data that underpins research outputs, whether it is shared or not, is integral to research integrity and reproducibility of results. Sharing data outputs also helps promote the work of our researchers and creates opportunities for future collaborations.

1.1.3  The University promotes compliance with relevant funder and publisher policies, supports the Concordat on Open Research Data and the UKRI Common Principles on Data and is committed to ensuring that access to data is as open as possible, as closed as necessary and, as appropriate, follows the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) principles for data management.

1.1.4 This policy is intended to promote good practice regarding research data, with the aim that it is:

a. stored securely and preserved in order to ensure its continuing utility;
b. appropriately identifiable, retrievable, and available when needed;
c. an accurate, complete, reliable and coherent representation of the materials collected;
d. kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, including UK Data Protection legislation and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and project-specific protocols approved under the University‚Äôs Research Ethics Policy;
e. able to be made available to others in line with appropriate ethical, data sharing and open research principles, especially when the data underpins published research."""^^xsd:string .

Given current trends in data management practices, the process of data management is becoming increasingly important. Whilst this is placing increased burdens on academic research, it also offers additional opportunities for demonstration of best practice and research environment both for the University and also for the individual.

For example, where applicable, making data openly and publicly available offers the potential to demonstrate additional impact from the research, on the wider academic community and also beyond. As the activity of data management becomes more important this will also become more explicitly recognised in Performance Development Reviews (PDRs), annual research reviews and annual PhD reviews.

In addition to helping demonstrate good practice in terms of research design, it is also recognised in the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) that the value of and impact of all research outputs including datasets and software as well as publications should be acknowledged."""^^xsd:string .

a. There is now a need to include a Data Availability Statement (or equivalent wording/information in a data/methods/acknowledgement section) in all papers, whether or not the journals require them.

b. Data sharing where possible/applicable is a requirement for data held by UoP. The minimum requirement is metadata necessary for reproduction of research results, with the best practice recommendation being making research data publicly and openly available to maximise the benefit for the academic and the institution. Depending on the subject area a publication in a data journal describing a dataset may be appropriate.

The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:

a. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.



b. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the ‚ÄúCreative Commons Zero‚Äù (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license ‚ÄúCreative Commons Attribution‚Äù (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the ‚ÄúAttribution‚Äù element are not suitable for licensing research data (‚ÄúNon-Commercial‚Äù, NC; ‚ÄúNo Derivative Works‚Äù, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (‚ÄúSharing under Equal Conditions‚Äù, SA).6



c. Research data for ‚ÄúScientific Use‚Äù only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.

d. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights).

Non-official translation of the policy ratified by Senate on September 25, 2019 and published in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen "Official Notices" Nr. 18 of September 30, 2019, pp. 1361-1362. The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially.



The University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg‚Äôs largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam.

Research data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes.



This policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the ‚ÄúPrinciples for Handling of Research Data‚Äù by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the ‚ÄúBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities‚Äù signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152.



This policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """I. Principles

(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited.



(2)	 The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available.

(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.



(4)	 All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account.

According to the Danish Code of Conduct for Research Integrity Research the term of research data contains two elements: primary materials and data.  Primary materials and data are defined as:  

Primary material is any material (e.g. biological material, notes, interviews, texts and literature, digital recordings, etc.) that forms the basis of the research.  

Data are the detailed records of the primary materials that comprise the basis for the analysis that generates the results.  

Research data management comprises the processes of collecting, processing, analysing, storing, sharing, long-term preserving, and disposing of research data. The key purpose of research data management is to ensure honest, transparent, and accountable research practices.  

The CBS Research Data Management Policy covers all kinds of primary materials and data relevant for CBS Research, but does not cover primary materials such as biological materials etc. Published and publicly available literature is considered as important primary material that is to be treated in accordance with the principles for Responsible Conduct.

The following points provide specific guidance for licensing:

a. Licensing and attribution: The obligation to attribute academic achievements is a principle of good scientific practice. Licenses and waivers for data and software that do not contractually require the attribution of the authors do not supersede this obligation. The preferred way to promote data and software citation is not through restrictive licensing but by including a recommended citation.



b. Public research data: Creative Commons tools have become the most common way to license research data that is made publicly available. Data that is free of copyright and related rights should be labelled as such upon release using the ‚ÄúCreative Commons Zero‚Äù (CC0) waiver. For data that is protected by copyright or related rights, using the CC0 waiver is also recommended because it is the best way to ensure reusability. The license ‚ÄúCreative Commons Attribution‚Äù (CC BY) can also be considered, but due to the strict formal requirements regarding attribution and the provision of license information it already limits subsequent use. Creative Commons licenses with terms that go beyond the ‚ÄúAttribution‚Äù element are not suitable for licensing research data (‚ÄúNon-Commercial‚Äù, NC; ‚ÄúNo Derivative Works‚Äù, ND), or are suitable only in certain cases and only to a limited extent (‚ÄúSharing under Equal Conditions‚Äù, SA).6



c. Research data for ‚ÄúScientific Use‚Äù only: Research data to which access has to be restricted should be licensed in consultation with the approriate data center using the licenses recommended by them.

d. Software: Creative Commons licenses (such as CC BY) are not suitable for software. A CC0 waiver can be granted for completely selfwritten code (to which the programmers own all rights).

Non-official translation of the policy ratified by Senate on September 25, 2019 and published in Amtliche Bekanntmachungen "Official Notices" Nr. 18 of September 30, 2019, pp. 1361-1362. The information regarding the novel DFG Code of Conduct in footnote 3 has been added editorially.



The University of Potsdam, as Brandenburg‚Äôs largest university, is oriented towards distinctive interdisciplinary research profiles in cooperation with a large number of non-university research institutions in the natural and human sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. In many of these areas, data are an essential basis of scientific knowledge; since 2019, data-centric sciences have been designated as one of four focus areas for research at the University of Potsdam.

Research data can be the foundation for further research as well as the transfer of knowledge and technology, including for purposes beyond those for which the data were collected. Therefore, publishing and archiving research data serve not only for the replicability and verification of earlier results but also for the finding of new results. Recent developments in good scientific practice have given rise to new requirements regarding the handling of research data. Moreover, the digital transformation in academia confronts researchers and research support staff with challenges regarding capabilities and infrastructural prerequisites for research data management. Making data publishing and research data management a self-evident part of research practice will require cultural changes.



This policy governs the handling of data that is generated, reused, or processed as part of the research methods for research projects. This includes the methods and test procedures available as data, such as questionnaires or software. It also serves to implement the ‚ÄúPrinciples for Handling of Research Data‚Äù by the Alliance of Science Organisations in Germany1 and the ‚ÄúBerlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities‚Äù signed by the University of Potsdam in 20152.



This policy applies to all researchers and research support staff at the University of Potsdam. The University of Potsdam will publish recommendations on how researchers and research support staff can comply with the requirements of this policy."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """I. Principles

(1) The University of Potsdam is committed to free access to research data. Research data should be made available for reuse as openly as possible, unless interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements prevent their publication. Research data that constitute the basis of published results should be made accessible promptly and linked to the publication appropriately. Research data with high reuse potential should be published in a quality-assured manner regardless of their use for a text publication. In order to improve reproducibility and to acknowledge underlying academic achievements, reused data and research software should be cited.



(2)	 The University of Potsdam ensures the archiving of research data. Research data that constitute the basis of a text publication but are not themselves published are to be archived for at least 10 years using a suitable infrastructure. Storage of research data exclusively by the researchers themselves or the immediate deletion of the data are permissible only if interests worthy of protection predominate or legal requirements stipulate this, or in case no suitable infrastructure for archiving these data is available.

(3) The University of Potsdam recognizes the preparation of research data for reuse and the development of reusable research software as academic achievements. The same applies to contributions to the advancement of discipline-specific good practice in the handling of research data and research software. The research output of the University of Potsdam includes quality-assured data and software publications that are recognized by the respective scientific community.



(4)	 All researchers are responsible for complying with good scientific practice regarding the handling of research data. The relevant discipline-specific guidelines by DFG review boards and academic associations on the handling of research data are to be taken into account. The following people bear special responsibility:

1. Principle investigators, in particular with regard to a project‚Äôs documentation, openness, and reusability of research data as well as data protection.
2. Research group leaders with regard to cross-project aspects of data handling (e.g., using common standards for the quality and storage of comparable data from several studies).



(5) Research students and early career researchers are entitled to appropriate information, qualification, and support from teaching staff and supervisors. In disciplines working with data, basics of the practical handling of research data should be taught as comprehensive course content, starting at the undergraduate level. Opportunities for postgraduate training should be created for young scientists, lecturers, and supervisors."""^^xsd:string .

Datasets can also be valuable research outputs in their own right, and should be managed in such a way as to maximise their potential for use and impact.

University researchers are required to plan for data management, to collect and manage data responsibly during the research process, and to preserve and make accessible to the fullest extent possible data that substantiate research findings, considering any legal, ethical, commercial or practical restrictions that may apply. Wherever possible, data must be preserved and made accessible by means of an appropriate data repository, and in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable research data.4"""^^xsd:string .

Sufficient data and supporting information to enable verification or reproduction of the research results and meaningful re-use should be preserved. Documentation should include details of the methods and instruments used to collect and process the data, and interpretive metadata, which may be in the form of a data dictionary or codebook.

While there may be legitimate legal and ethical reasons why some data cannot be shared, these can often be addressed by redaction of a dataset, for example to remove personal data, and/or by depositing data in a repository that provides access to data on a controlled basis (for example, subject to authorisation and under a data access agreement). Most data collected from participants can be preserved and shared on some basis. Researchers must inform participants of the intention to share data, either openly or under safeguards, during recruitment. Failure to do this is poor research practice.

Sharing of data obtained from and about Indigenous Peoples should respect Indigenous Peoples' rights and interests in their data and should be undertaken in accordance with the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance.23

Some areas of research, for example computational modelling, can generate large volumes of synthetic data. In such cases it may be more important - and more viable - to preserve the reproducibility of a method rather than a specific set of outputs, which might have little long-term value and be prohibitively expensive to maintain. It may be sufficient to preserve the code used to execute a model along with information about the input data used and the computing environment in which the model was run.

A data repository is a service that exists to preserve and provide access to research data. It supports the long-term management of and access to data in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles. Among other things a repository will:

apply data and metadata standards to support interoperability and re-use;
publish machine-readable metadata about a dataset to enable online discovery;
assign a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI, to a dataset to make it citable and discoverable;
publish licence information to facilitate re-use.

A data repository should be the preferred solution for data preservation and sharing. Sharing of raw data as supplementary information alongside the article on the publisher‚Äôs website should be avoided. It is not acceptable to retain data in closed storage, to be made available on request, except where there is a well-founded legal, ethical, commercial or practical reason for doing so.

Most data collected from research participants can be deposited in a data repository either as anonymised open data, or, in the case of higher risk anonymised or identifiable data, by using a data repository that can hold and provide access to datasets under a controlled access procedure. For example, the UK Data Service can hold safeguarded data, and the University‚Äôs Research Data Archive can manage restricted datasets.

Data centres and repositories serving disciplinary communities and catering to specialised types of research data should be used where they are available and suitable. Requirements or preferences of funders should be taken into account when considering the most suitable place of deposit for research data.

data models and associated formats for encoding specific types of data, e.g. the Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) standard for the numerical representation of scientific data, widely used in climate modelling, and the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard for organising neuroimaging and behavioural data; metadata standards for the structured description of data objects;29

Data repository: a service that provides long-term preservation of and access to research data in accordance with the FAIR Data Principles. Among other things a repository will:

apply data and metadata standards to support interoperability and re-use;
publish machine-readable metadata about a dataset to enable online discovery;
assign a persistent unique identifier, such as a DOI, to a dataset to make it citable;
publish licence information to facilitate re-use.

Data repositories may serve defined disciplinary research communities or members of a research-performing organisation or operate as public data sharing services.

FAIR Data Principles: a widely-accepted set of principles for the management of research data in ways that facilitate discovery, access and re-use. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable.36

Principal Investigator: The individual at the University with overall responsibility for the conduct of a research project. Doctoral supervisors are included under this definition.

Research data: the information collected or created, processed and studied for the purpose of answering a research question, and which constitute the evidential basis that substantiates research findings. They may be primary data generated or collected by the researcher or existing sources consulted and processed as part of the research activity. Research data may be digital or non-digital, and may include, but are not limited to: results of experiments or simulations, statistics and measurements, computational models, software and code, fieldwork observations, survey results, interview recordings and transcripts, images from cameras and scientific equipment, databases, textual or linguistic corpora, lab books, and physical objects, such as samples and specimens.

Research data management (or RDM): the sum of activities undertaken by researchers and research organisations in relation to the collection, processing, preservation, sharing and disposal of research data.

The University of Strathclyde (hereafter ‚Äòthe University‚Äô) believes that the highest standards of research quality and integrity are facilitated by the application of good practice in research data management and sharing (RDMS). The creation of and provision for data resources (i.e. digital data/files and analogue data) at research institutions is central to maintaining a progressive research environment. Research funders are also setting increasingly ambitious research data management and sharing expectations for Researchers and their institutions. This is in furtherance of their broader open research goals, particularly in promoting superior transparency of research findings (e.g. verification, reproducibility and replicability). Such a trend has therefore become reputational and is reflected in a growing number of scholarly journals and communities of practice, many of which mandate openness and sharing of any data accompanying publications.

Research data processed by University Researchers (as defined in 1.2) is expected to be managed to a high standard throughout the research data lifecycle in support of the University‚Äôs Strategic Plan; to avoid data loss, contractual and/or data protection breaches; and to widely share the evidence which underpins research, for societal and public benefit. The University supports Researchers to achieve excellence through the provision of systems, infrastructure, tools, training and guidance via our cross-functional Research Data Management and Sharing (RDMS) Service."""^^xsd:string .

In recognition that not all research data can be shared openly, the University‚Äôs approach to assessing the suitability of data for sharing is that data should be ‚Äòas open as possible and as closed as necessary‚Äô.

In line with the University‚Äôs strategic commitment to progress towards FAIR open data policies, whenever possible data and/or descriptive metadata produced by the University should be:

Findable: easy to find for both humans and computers.
Accessible: accompanied by clear instructions for access and authorisation.
Interoperable: can be integrated with other data and/or work in conjunction with applications or workflows for analysis, storage and processing.
Reusable: suitably described to allow further use, released with a clear and accessible data usage licence.

Data Management Plan. A document addressing how research data will be captured, managed, stored, shared, and published, and how the integrity, security, and confidentiality of data will be maintained. It should be updated as necessary throughout active research projects.

Metadata. Any documentation and descriptive information relevant to research data and research conclusions can be considered metadata. Some scholarly communities may have formal metadata standards for research data, which researchers should follow when appropriate. Metadata records in this policy refer to descriptive information about research data that is held by the Library to facilitate discoverability, sharing, and retention.

Open Access repository. An Open Access repository is an online database of research outputs, configured to support the storage, online discovery and machine-readability of its content. Institutional repositories, such as the University of Surrey Open Access repository, hold the research outputs of their institution. They can include publications, theses, research data and other research outputs; Open Access as well as restricted items; and full texts as well as bibliographic records. Subject or disciplinary repositories, such as PubMedCentral, can host outputs from several institutions.

Research data. The University of Surrey considers research data to be any material collected, observed, processed, or created for the purpose of analysis and on which research findings and outputs are based. This includes data and documentation which is commonly accepted in the scholarly community as necessary for validation or replication of research findings. Research data may be in digital or non-digital formats.

Researchers. The University of Surrey defines researchers as members of the University, including staff, doctoral and postgraduate students, visiting researchers, and those who conduct research on University premises, use University facilities for research, or work on University research projects."""^^xsd:string .

The policy reflects the UWE Bristol Open Research Statement which encourages our researchers to be as open as possible, as early as possible, and to explore options for open research including open access publication of research findings and open sharing of data, taking account of university and other policies.

Research data management is the effective handling of data that is accessed, used or created in the course of research. Effective research data management is carried out for the entire lifecycle of the research data, from the point of creation through to dissemination, publication and archiving. Aspects of research data management will usually continue long after the initial research project has ended.

Managing and sharing research data can increase its visibility (and consequently the visibility of research), ensuring the full potential of research is exploited. This can then provide a growing resource for further research, education and training."""^^xsd:string .

Data Management Plans (DMPs) are living documents that describe how data will be managed during the life of the project. As living documents, they can and should be updated throughout the course of the project. DMPs are often requested by funders at the bid stage and should state what data will be created and how, outline plans for sharing and preservation and note any restrictions on access.

Data repository: storage space for Researchers to deposit datasets associated with their research.

DOI: Digital Object Identifier.

Dynamic data: data that is collected during an active research project. This is likely to change throughout the project.

Metadata: literally ‚Äúdata about other data‚Äù. In the context of this document, it refers to descriptive or contextual information that helps the identification, location, retrieval of and access to data and research outputs.

Principal Investigator (PI): the individual leading a programme of research.

Research Data: includes a range of sources that have been used to carry out the research. They may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound/video recordings, sketchbooks, transcripts of interviews, survey data etc. The primary purpose of research data is to provide the information necessary to support or validate a research project's observations, findings or outputs.

Technical support requirements for the collection, storage and processing of research data should be considered at the planning stage. Information about data storage and other support for the management of research data provided by IT can be found at  

On completion of the project, data selected for archiving should be stored in a suitable data repository, that meets the stated criteria.

Any external data repository selected must not charge any fee for access to the stored data. Where use of a specific data repository is mandated by the funder, Researchers must comply.

A metadata record for all archive research data hosted internally and externally must be added to the University Repository. Researchers are advised to review the FAIR Principles -   - for guidance on the construction of appropriate metadata.

Research data selected for archiving should normally be preserved and accessible for a period of 10 years, but a longer period should be considered for projects of major clinical, social or environmental importance.

In 2015 the UT accepted the first version of a research data policy.

This is due to the growing attention to the proper handling of research data in scientific practice, the increasing amount of (digital) data, and the growing demand of integrity and open science. Therefore, the UT-data policy of 2015 is updated, resulting in this RDM policy, which pays more attention to the benefits of RDM for the researcher and gives more specifically defined instructions on good research data management at the UT.

The aim of this RDM policy is to stimulate the awareness of the need and benefits of good research data management (section 2) and offer clear rules for managing research data at the UT (section 3). Both sections are relevant for the main target group: the UT scientific community, e.g. researchers and research managers, who have the main responsibility of data management in research projects.

Good RDM allows for the publishing of datasets and consequently its citation. This improves the visibility of your research and therefore its citation rate, reputation, and its scientific impact.
When citizen science is used for data collection, and open data are used by societal parties, societal impact is improved.

Good RDM improves the quality of research. Your data are always accurate, complete, authentic and reliable. Making the data early and easy available to colleagues and reviewers, provides you with an extra quality check.
On the basis of your data, others can quite simply verify your results. Open data reduces the risk of manipulation.
RDM reduces the risk of data loss by keeping your research data safe and secure.
After an initial investment in time, planning for your data management needs and
documenting your data throughout its life cycle can save you time and resources in the long run.
Enabling other researchers to use your data or being able to use other researchers data prevents duplication of effort.

3. Reuse, new results and new collaborations

You can benefit from findable and reusable high quality data collected by other researchers. Reuse and re-analysis of data make possible the testing of new or alternative hypotheses and methods of analysis; enables the exploration of topics not envisioned by the initial investigators; encourages diversity of analysis and opinion. Combining datasets from multiple sources through meta-analysis promotes new types of research and permits the creation of new data sets, information, and knowledge. Open data practices facilitate collaboration within and outside your discipline.

As a general starting point the UT RDM policy implies that faculties and/or research groups

support the implementation of the FAIR-principles: Research data must be Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable (see appendix 1)
commit to the general principle that research data is classified as public data unless there are
specific requirements to maintain the confidentiality of research data, such as when a
researcher is bound to protect the confidential information of a collaborating company or
when the data relates to human subjects
stimulate awareness regarding RDM practices and develop a culture in which researchers are
stimulated to and rewarded for sharing data
include the provision of RDM-training and -support to researchers
facilitate solid infrastructure and tools for storing and archiving research data both during
and after the research
monitor the development and execution of Data Management Plans (DMP)"""^^xsd:string .

Good RDM starts with the writing of a data management plan . Most research funders require a DMP as part of funding application or to be handed in shortly after the start of the project. Specific RDM regulations in the faculty must describe the procedure about when and where a DMP has to be handed in and how reviewing and monitoring is organized.

Every research project must have a DMP. The DMP can be derived from the specific RDM regulations and procedures at the nearest organizational level in the faculty.
Every PhD-student follows the TGS-course Research Data Management as a preparation of the writing of a DMP.
The DMP has to be reviewed and monitored regularly, in line with planning and progress of the research project."""^^xsd:string .

The University of Westminster recognises that the good management of research data throughout the research lifecycle improves the transparency, integrity, reproducibility, and reach of scholarly research. Good research data management underpins the University‚Äôs strategic commitment to open research, which, in turn, is a key driver in achieving the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals‚Äô call for public access to information for all (Goal 16, Target 10). The University‚Äôs Code of Research Good Practice formalises the importance of best practice in the management of research data and research related records to the University‚Äôs commitment to supporting ‚Äúa research environment that is underpinned by a culture of integrity‚Äù.1 The University of Westminster‚Äôs Digital Strategy commits to ensuring that safe, secure, and compliant systems and processes exist for the collection, storage, sharing, and preservation of research data.

In parallel, research funders and sponsors have clear policies relating to research data management and open research data. UKRI‚Äôs commitment to making publicly funded research data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable in line with the FAIR Data Principles is affirmed by the Common principles on research data (RCUK, 2011) and the Concordat on Open Research Data (HEFCE, UKRI, UUK, and Wellcome, 2016). Horizon Europe (European Commission, 2022) requires ‚Äúopen access to research data under the principle ‚Äòas open as possible, as closed as necessary‚Äô‚Äù.2 It is recognised that researchers cannot meet open research data expectations without support from their institution.

Managing research data effectively:

increases the visibility and integrity of scholarly research;
maximises the utility and reusability of research data;
maximises the potential for collaboration;
mitigates against the risk of accidental loss of research data;
mitigates against the accidental or inappropriate release of personal data and sensitive information;
ensures the long-term preservation of and access to research datasets;
enables research data to be shared as a public good.

This policy outlines the obligations of and key expectations for researchers and the institution in relation to the management and preservation of research data and research related records created at the University of Westminster. This policy clarifies the responsibilities of both individual researchers and the institution in relation to good research data management and support."""^^xsd:string .

2.10 The ‚Äúraw‚Äù data generated through research is normally subject to some form of processing. It may be entered into a database, digitised, transcribed, transliterated or translated. During this process it may be checked and cleaned; it may be subject to annotation and in some instances anonymisation.

2.11 It is essential that data is processed to the highest possible standards to ensure the integrity and quality of the data.

2.12 Researchers are expected to:

Produce processed data that is accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;
Process data ensuring that all ethical requirements are met.

2.14 All data generated in the course of a research project, both processed and unprocessed, should normally be stored securely and safely. This is a legislative requirement for personal data but it is recommended that all data is treated in this manner to ensure the integrity of that data. However, there may be contexts where this is neither practicable nor desirable, e.g. where the ‚Äúdata‚Äù generated are artefacts such as sculptures or paintings presented in a public space.

2.15 Researchers are expected to:

Store all data, unprocessed and processed, whether digital or in some other form, securely and safely for the lifetime of the project unless there is a clear rationale why this is not possible or desirable
Use digital storage that is fit for purpose, both in terms of its security and its size - for this reason the robust, managed storage provided by the University is the recommended option Back up all digital data and hold copies of data in other forms as far as that is possible and practicable on a regular basis

2.17 High quality research data are a public good and therefore should be preserved and made accessible to others unless there is a clear reason not to. Reasons include but are not limited to:

Consent for participation was subject to data not being preserved
Ethical considerations, such as need to ensure anonymity, argue against preserving the data
The data is insufficiently robust or meaningful to warrant preservation
The data does not have long-term value

2.18 The length of time data must be preserved may be determined by a funder; where this time period is not defined by the funder or the research is unfunded, it is recommended that data is preserved for a minimum of 10 years.

2.19 It may not be practicable or appropriate to preserve all data generated or processed in the course of a project and decisions will need to be made as to what data should be preserved. This decision should be in accordance with any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements. Keeping these requirements in mind, preserved data should allow a clear assessment of any published work arising from the research.

2.20 Researchers are expected to:

Identify if, how and for how long data will be preserved at the planning stage and
communicate this to participants;
Preserve appropriate data that belongs to the University (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the exclusions in 2.17);
Preserve appropriate data that belongs to the funder (subject to any legal, ethical, funder or collaborator requirements and the obligations set out in the contract or research
agreement);
Transfer digital data to a suitable file format to ensure that it is accessible in the long term; this will often mean using non-proprietary file formats
Migrate data to a suitable repository; this may be a University repository and/or an external data repository (general or subject-based).

2.23 It is important that preserved data is easily discoverable and that it is accompanied by sufficient metadata to enable other researchers to understand the research and re-use potential of the data.

2.24 Researchers are expected to:

Produce metadata and documentation to describe the data (sufficient to understand what research data exists, why, when and how it was generated), to identify who owns the data

and where it is archived, and to set out how the data can be accessed and any restrictions on access.

    ns1:text """Preamble

The University of Bayreuth pursues the goal of creating and preserving knowledge, providing impulses for creative thinking and making new findings accessible and usable for the scientific community and society as well as for future generations.

At the basis of all scientific work, research data has long-term benefits for research and science and offers the potential for broad reuse in society. The University of Bayreuth considers the responsible and sustainable handling of research data and its documentation to be an essential contribution to the scientific research and knowledge process as well as to scientific integrity and strives for a high standard in this respect. The University of Bayreuth recognizes that structured, comprehensively documented and easily retrievable research data is an essential part of a research project. Well managed research data enable the reproducibility of research processes and their results.

Research Data Management (RDM) is part of the University of Bayreuth's 2025 Structure and Development Plan1. It is supported by corresponding measures initiated by the Vice President for Digitalization, Innovation & Sustainability and the Vice President for Research & Junior Scholars, as well as the central institutes IT Service Centre, University Library, and Research Support Office.

The aim of the University of Bayreuth‚Äôs RDM Policy is to raise awareness of the importance of research data and to provide researchers and early-career scholars at the University of Bayreuth with information on how to handle research data, thereby contributing to a quality-oriented, accessible, and sustainable research environment. The Policy follows the recommendations made by the German Science and Humanities Council (2012)2 and the German Rectors' Conference (2014)3 as well as the "Guidelines for Handling Research Data"4 and the "Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Research Practice"5 published by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

The University of Bayreuth has formulated the present Policy on the basis of the first version of a RDM Policy published on 8 November 20166 and in accordance with The University of Bayreuth‚Äôs Statutes for safeguarding the standards of good scientific practice and handling scientific misconduct7. In addition, the Open Access Strategy of the University of Bayreuth8 and the University of Bayreuth‚Äôs Strategy for Handling Intellectual Property (IP) in Knowledge and Technology Transfer9 needs to be observed as well."""^^xsd:string .

All data that are generated, collected, observed, simulated, or derived in the research process are regarded as research data. Typical examples of research data are measurement data, laboratory values, audiovisual information, texts, survey results, objects from collections, methodological test procedures or simulations, source code, and protocols. The range of data types reflects the diversity and methodological development of scientific disciplines and research procedures. Research data can arise in various forms during the research project (different format variants of primary data, processed data including negative or ambiguous results, shared data, published data) and can be provided with different access authorizations, e.g. as open, restricted, or non-public data. For the provision and subsequent use of research data, it is necessary to document the context in which the data were generated and to document (as metadata) the tools and methods used in this process.

Research data management

Research data management encompasses all measures for the quality assurance of research data during their life cycle; from the planning and implementation of the research project, to the generation, documentation and processing of data, to the assigning of metadata, to data storage during the research project, and to long-term data storage after the research has been completed.

Research data within the meaning of this policy is understood to mean both genuinely digital data that is collected, generated or obtained during or as a result of research work (which includes, but is not limited to, conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting experiments, surveys, interviews or the analysis of data), as well as data that are generated in analogue formats or already exist and are digitized in further processing. Research data also includes those data that document the actual data generation and ensure the reproducibility of the data (metadata).

Due to the range of disciplines, the resulting research data is heterogeneous with respect to the data types and formats; these can consist, for example, of text modules, survey data, measurement, observation data, databases, questionnaires, protocols, audio data and audio-visual data, as well as simulation data and software source code, provided that this is a central result of scientific research. Here, the data life cycle of research data can have various stations which differ in terms of quality states or processing statuses and are fundamentally classified as open, access-restricted and nonpublic research data depending on their access authorizations. Research data management deals with the organization and documentation of the data, storage, archiving, data security, the protection of personal data as well as publication and sharing with third parties.

Research data management covers the entire life cycle of the research data, from data generation to archiving or re-use and includes both the organization and documentation of the generated data, as well as the storage, backup and accessibility (publication) of the data. Adequate research data management ensures that the data can be processed and interpreted in the context of the research project.

Sustainable research data management begins before the actual data generation in the context of the creation of a data management plan that takes into account all the necessary resources for both the storage and the management of the data. In particular, the project-related physical storage media must be described in full, including software solutions that are used here, and also any personnel costs or license fees. Where personal data are processed, they must be anonymized or pseudonymized as soon as the research purpose allows. In the case of pseudonymization, the characteristics with which the personal reference can be restored must be stored separately from the research data. In addition, the data management plan contains information on project managers, the use and publication of the data and agreements on authorship and copyright. During the course of the research project, the data management plan is regularly reviewed and, if necessary, updated. Responsibility for the entire research data management as well as the preparation and regular review of the data management plan lies with the respective project managers.

This data management plan must already be drawn up for many funding applications from thirdparty funding providers and submitted upon application, for example under the Horizon 2020 programme .

After metadata has been attributed, the data should be stored in sustainable, lossless and open data formats on data storage devices and backed up.

Saarland University supports researchers in ensuring the broadest possible visibility of their research, as well as the subsequent use of the data. Therefore, the metadata of the research project should always be provided with a unique persistent identifier, for example a DOI. The primary data can also be retrieved and stored in a subject-specific repository. When selecting the publication medium, it is recommended that the data is kept freely available for scientific purposes. This can be done by issuing open licenses for usage rights (e.g. Creative Commons CC-BY for data or GNU Affero General Public License for (software) source code).

    ns1:text """I. Planning phase: before the research project

While planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project.

The Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3.

It is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document).

Most funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university's basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services.

While planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """II. Implementation phase: during the research project

Storing and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used.

In terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.

use of network file systems (including data backup)
mass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring
renting virtual servers (server hosting)
accommodation of real servers (server housing)
block storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage
network)
data exchange services
versioning services
long-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)

Detailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.

The reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used.

In the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions.

In collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon."""^^xsd:string .

a research data management plan and ensuring the full research team and collaborators are aware of and adhere to it.

Many funders require researchers to submit a data management plan as part of the application process. Researchers should respect the data management policies of the funder(s) and other external parties. Many public funders of research, including all the UK Research Councils, accept that the management of research data is a legitimate research expense.

Research projects requiring ethical approval should use the data management plan provided in the online ethical approval application form. Projects not requiring ethical approval should complete the Wrexham University Data Management Plan Template. When preparing an application, researchers applying for funding should consider the terms and requirements listed in the funder policy documents. Researchers can access DMPOnline to view the data management plan templates based on the requirements listed in the funder policy documents.

The UK GDPR creates a legal obligation to think about and mitigate data protection issues and privacy concerns at the project planning stage before any data is gathered. A Date Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is an assessment to help researchers identify any potential risks a project might have as regards intruding into participants' privacy. The DPIA then assists with implementing appropriate measures and controls to minimise and manage those risks. The legislation has made DPIAs mandatory for higher-risk data processing to ensure that privacy and data protection are key considerations from the start of any project and then taken into account throughout the project's lifecycle.

The European Commission (DG Research and Innovation) recommends that a DPIA be carried out for data processing operations that may entail higher ethical risks, such as:

 TypesofPersonal Data Racial or ethnic origin Political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs Genetic, biometric or health data Sex Life or sexual orientation Trade Union membership 
Data Subjects Children Vulnerable people People who have not given their explicit consent to participate in the project

A DPIA screening is included in the Research Ethics Committee approval process. However, some funders will require a separate DPIA, which should be completed using the University Data Protection Impact Assessment Template or one provided by the funder if that is specified. In cases where a research project does not require ethical review, researchers must still complete a DPIA screening and, if necessary, a full assessment, which must be authorised by the Data Protection Officer.

The University mandates that a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is completed prior to the commencement of a research project that is likely to result in high risk to individuals. The DPIA process is a legal requirement and an important tool to help you identify and minimise the data protection risks of a project involving personal data processing.

Transferring Data Outside the EU

The UK GDPR does not allow the transfer of personal data outside the EU or a country without adequate protection without meeting a condition like explicit consent or a binding contract.

ETH Zurich considers Research Data of high quality as an essential resource and Research Data Management as part of good scientific practice according to internationally recognised standards for scientific integrity. ETH is convinced that good data management enhances the robustness of research findings, facilitates research collaborations, makes research results more reproducible, and strengthens society‚Äôs trust in science.  

ETH Zurich therefore commits to creating a research environment that supports FAIR4 Research Data Management by design. ETH Zurich engages on a national and international level to provide a sustainable and suitable infrastructure for Research Data Management to offer its researchers information and services that satisfy the highest standards. The ideal to be strived for is Open Research Data (ORD) ‚Äî the practice of making Research Data publicly available, accessible and reusable while always respecting legal and ethical framework conditions (‚Äúas open as possible, as closed as necessary‚Äù).  

The Guidelines for Research Data Management (hereinafter ‚ÄúRDM Guidelines‚Äù) specify further details of Research Data Management in accordance with Art. 10 Para. 4 of the ETH Zurich Guidelines on scientific integrity (Integrity Guidelines)5. They take into account strategic developments and activities on the national level and within the ETH Domain6. They serve to establish minimal requirements for all ETH Zurich members involved in scientific research and to define responsibilities.

b. Commercial platforms which are well-suited for specific purposes (e.g. code development) are usually not considered as FAIR repositories. In case such platforms are used, a copy of the version of Programming Code belonging to a result publication must be archived in a FAIR repository.19   
c. Commercial repositories should be avoided whenever possible.  

3 Restrictions  

Restrictions on sharing and publishing Research Data and Programming Code may be justified and, in some cases, necessitated by the following reasons:  

a. constraints due to institutional provisions and/or applicable superordinate national and/or international ethical principles and/or legal regulations;   
b. ongoing preparation of a patent application;   
c. contractual obligations (e.g. to industry partners);   
d. intended commercial use of a software linked to a data set;

## Preamble  

Research data represents a central element of both academic activity and the ensuing acquisition of knowledge, and thereby serves as an essential tool for acquiring knowledge. In the following, ‚Äòresearch data‚Äô is defined as all data collected, mined, simulated or derived in connection with a research process. The University of M√ºnster (WWU) regards research data, therefore, as an academic product, to which it attaches great importance. In order to acquire, disseminate and substantiate scientific findings, it is therefore absolutely vital that University staff manage research data in a responsible and academically appropriate manner.1 Handling such data requires early implementation of a research data management policy. This comprises all phases of planning and execution, i.e. generation and collection, as well as the processing, application and storage of research data. It also includes the documentation of the context and tools used for collecting this data, as well as provisions detailing its subsequent use, reproducibility and quality assurance.  

## Principles  

Based on ‚ÄúThe German Research Foundation‚Äôs (DFG) Recommendations on Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice‚Äù2, the ‚ÄúRules of Good Scientific Practice of the University of M√ºnster‚Äù3 and the ‚ÄúDFG Guidelines on the Handling of Research Data‚Äù4, the University of M√ºnster provides the following principles to serve as a guideline for its researchers.

The Faculty of Applied Sciences Research Data Management Policy is part of the central TU Delft Research Data Framework Policy (which outlines the roles of the Library, ICT Department, University Services and the Executive Board at TU Delft, and from which italic sentences in this policy are derived).1 This policy helps create effective practices for working with research data at the faculty, and defines data management roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders within the Faculty from the 1st of January 2020 onwards.  

The principles outlined in this policy are elaborated in more detail, with supporting information available in the online guidance.2  

This policy is motivated by the belief that good data management leads to research that is more time- and cost-efficient as it prevents data loss and duplication of efforts and can contribute to the quality, reproducibility and impact of research. This policy is inspired by the FAIR principles: research data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) by archiving the data with proper documentation."""^^xsd:string .

The GDPR defines personal data as: any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person who is still alive. This means information that either relates directly to a person or can be traced back to that person.2 Personal data can also be provided to third parties, for example, during interviews or in open questions for surveys.  

Research projects in which interviews or surveys are used often involve personal data, i.e. the contact details of the research population. Even though personal data usually are irrelevant for the research, they do form part of the total research data and partially safeguard the integrity of the research."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """Data package  

A coherent set of data and procedures that has been stored unchanged for a longer period of time (archived). A data package contains a description, also referred to as metadata, which clearly shows the content of the package. Based on the data package and the accompanying metadata, it must be possible to validate the claims that are based on the data concerned.  

A data package can consist of different data, such as multiple tables, scripts for statistical processing, stimulus material, audio files containing interviews and the interview transcripts in text files.  

Archiving (of data packages)  

This refers to the storage of data in an unchanged form for a longer period of time. In many cases data are packaged together with a code book, a lab journal (or archive journal) and a description of the data, the metadata. The set of data and the accompanying description are referred to as a data package. Data packages are archived at the time at which a scientific publication is based on the data package or at the end of a research project.  

Publication (of digital data)  

If the data are archived as a data package, the package can subsequently be published. This means that the data package will be findable. In practice, the publication of a data package means that the metadata are published (in a data catalogue, for example).  

Although publication makes a data package findable, this does not mean that the data are automatically accessible: a data package can be published as a ‚ÄòClosed Access Package‚Äô (see also p. 6). A persistent identifier, a reference that enables the clear referencing and easy localisation of digital data, is assigned upon publication of the data package."""^^xsd:string .

A general principle is that every staff member is expected to manage relevant data as a good steward. In addition, Utrecht University specifically distinguishes between the following actors, each bearing their own responsibilities for data management.  

1. The data creators: researchers and PhD candidates and support staff, who have primary responsibility for looking after the research data. In the case of students, the responsibility lies with their supervisor(s). Supervisor(s) ensure that students are aware of the guidelines on responsible data management. In the case of support staff, the responsibility lies with the researcher ultimately responsible for the particular project.  

2. Directors of education and research directors are responsible for ensuring that the researchers, research leaders, students and their supervisors in the department abide by the university policy framework and any supplementary faculty regulations. They may also establish further guidelines as needed.  

3. Deans draw up further faculty guidelines pursuant to the university policy framework and are responsible for ensuring that the directors of education and research directors implement both the university policy framework and the faculty guidelines.  

4. The Executive Board draws up, ensures monitoring and facilitates the implementation of the general university framework, for example, through the provision of infrastructure, information and other forms of support."""^^xsd:string .

Data storage and archiving  

The management of research data often relates to forms of storage. A distinction is made between the storage of data used in ongoing research projects and archival storage (see p. 6).  

The storage of data used in ongoing research projects relates to data and scripts that have been created, adjusted and possibly deleted again during the course of the research project. In archival storage the data are stored unchanged for a predetermined period of time.  

The principle underlying the faculty policy is that archival storage must be used as soon as the data concerned are used to substantiate a scientific claim, for instance, for a scientific publication."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """Rights  

Utrecht University has the authority to make decisions on data packages stored under the management of Utrecht University on its own infrastructure to the extent that these decisions do not conflict with earlier agreements made with the researcher(s) or between the researcher(s) and other rightholders. Examples are: transferring the data package to another data archive (such as DANS Narcis) or the migration of file formats. Exclusive rights for the reuse or publication of research data will not be transferred to commercial publishers and their representatives without the owners themselves retaining the right to make available the research data for reuse through open access, unless this originally was a precondition for the provision of funds.  

Any researcher who is responsible for a research project must draw up a data management plan (DMP) in any event prior to publication, but preferably before the start of the research project. The DMP should at least describe what data will be collected as part of the project, where the data will be stored and who has access to the data during the research project. It also states where (a version of) the data is archived as a data package, how the data package can be found, who can access it and under what conditions.  

If personal data are used in a research project, the DMP should explicitly describe what additional measures have been taken to ensure the lawful and careful handling of personal data. This might include a description of the legal basis for collecting the data (e.g. informed consent), the anonymisation method, and processing upon completion of the project (e.g. the destruction of contact details). Furthermore, a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) must be carried out.3 Finally, the data collection must be registered by the faculty data manager. The responsible researcher initiates these activities and ensures completion in the correct manner.  

In the case of human subject research, a proposal should furthermore be submitted to the Faculty Ethical Review Committee (FETC) prior to conducting the research.4 Data may not be collected until a positive assessment has been received."""^^xsd:string .

It offers support to researchers, especially in designing a research data management plan, and in selecting and implementing the best archiving and, where applicable, publishing strategy. Where researchers are dealing with more complex requirements, the Office of the General Counsel, the Central Ethics Committee, and ZEDAT also offer advice on finding tailored solutions for specific legal, ethical, and technical issues. The University Library also supports researchers through training in basic skills and norms in relation to research data management. It can advise the departments and other units in setting up and developing their own training programs, e.g., for Collaborative Research Centers (CRCs). ZEDAT offers one-on-one consultations for researchers along with workshops for small or large working groups on subjects such as computation for scientists, finding the right software, and identifying capacity needs, for example, for big data projects‚Äâ31.  

The Open Access Policy of Freie Universit√§t Berlin‚Äâ32 encourages the idea that publishable research data should be accessible, and the university supports all researchers in making this possible as well as supporting recognition for data publications and developed software. The university strongly recommends that researchers consider and implement the relevant practices when handling research data in the context of assessing final theses and dissertations, in evaluations, and recruitment and appointment procedures.

This policy applies to all research-related analog data, documents, and objects that are to be digitized in the course of a given research process as well as to ‚Äúborn digital‚Äù (i.e., originally created in a digital medium) data, documents, and objects produced in the course of a research process and/or that are the object or result of such a process. Research data are also defined as any data that facilitate the documentation, transparency, and ‚Äì depending on the research area ‚Äì replication of research outcomes (metadata).10  

Common examples of such research data are digitizations, audiovisual data, digital representations of analog data, measurement data, observation data, survey data, texts and text editions, databases, object collections, protocols, methodological test procedures, questionnaires, software, and simulations.11 The German Research Foundation (DFG) also defines source code and software as research data where they represent central outcomes of scientific research.12 The broad spectrum of data types reflects the diversity of scientific disciplines and their different research methods and processes.  

In the course of the research process, research data can take on several forms. They may vary in quality depending on how they are prepared or if additional data are added. The form of the data may also depend on the stage of processing, or they may be provided in different formats for presentation purposes. Furthermore, they may be subject to varying access regulations (open data, restricted data, closed data).  

The management of research data is an ongoing part of the entire research process. It includes the organization, documentation, storage, back-up, archiving, sharing, and publication of data. Research data management not only increases the visibility of the generated and/or processed data, but also the related research. It also helps to improve data quality and data processing, while making subsequent use of the data easier both for the original researchers and for others. Moreover, it facilitates the use of data in new contexts created when different data sets are linked. Sustainable research data management ensures the fulfillment of subject-specific requirements, as well as potential obligations related to funding agreements. It also helps meet publishers‚Äô standards and requirements, as well as ensuring compliance with the principles of good scientific practice."""^^xsd:string .

The DMP should include details on how data will be collected, administered, secured, stored, used, and published. It should also include an agreement on data organization, the assignment of responsibilities, intellectual property,16 regulations regarding staff fluctuation, as well as specifications on data access. The data management plan should be reviewed regularly in the course of the research project and updated whenever necessary.  

Descriptive metadata should be linked to the research data on an ongoing basis as an integrated part of the research project rather than waiting until the project is completed. It is also essential that the methods and tools used to generate, enrich, structure, and analyze the data are documented in full. This ensures compliance with quality standards, helps to keep the process transparent, and also ensures that the research can be replicated in accordance with the respective subject-specific norms. The University Library can help with choosing suitable tools for this process."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """I. Planning phase: before the research project  

While planning a research activity in which data are collected or where data form the basis of your research, it is highly recommended to examine the requirements and possibilities for efficient and sustainable research data management from early on. The Research Data Management Helpdesk is there to assist you in determining your individual requirements, find out about services and funding opportunities, and to develop a suitable strategy for your project.  

The Service center for research and transfer2 provides general advice on proposals for third-party funding. Coordinated programs of the DFG (e.g. SFBs, research groups) are supported by the office of the Vice-President for Research3.  

It is recommended, and also required by some funding organisations, to create and submit a data management plan (DMP). A DMP contains the requirements as well as the technical and organisational measures ensuring a sustainable handling of research data during, and after, the project life-time. Throughout a project the DMP serves as a reference and guideline. It may evolve over time if conditions or requirements change (keyword: living document).  

Most funding organisations expect not only the long-term safekeeping of research data but also its publication. A suitable strategy should be determined in the proposal phase. Costs for research data management (e.g. labour, storage, publication), which cannot be covered by the university's basic facilities, should be requested in the proposal. The university computer centre assists you in determining the necessary IT infrastructure and services.  

While planning a research project, in particular, when publishing results, legal constraints apply and must be taken into account. Certain research data in the social sciences, life sciences and medicine, for example, are subject to strict conditions, such as privacy protection laws or require prior assessment by an ethics committee. Additionally, the protection of copyrights and legitimate interests of third parties must be ensured. It is recommended to clarify legal questions in advance while planning a research project. The legal department4 is there to advise you on these matters."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """II. Implementation phase: during the research project  

Storing and processing, as well as collaborating on research data, should adhere to state-of-the-art IT principles. This includes, first and foremost, securing data in terms of accessibility, integrity (unaltered) and authenticity. For example, procedures for data backups and archiving need to be in place and secure data exchange platforms and versioning tools should be used.  

In terms of research data the university computer centre (URZ)5 provides (among other things) the following services. The services are offered partly free of charge as basic infrastructure or can be provided at net cost.  

use of network file systems (including data backup)   
mass storage (archive storage) including data mirroring   
renting virtual servers (server hosting)   
accommodation of real servers (server housing)   
block storage services for servers (virtual disks via a dedicated storage   
network)   
data exchange services   
versioning services   
long-term archiving services (in cooperation with ThULB)  

Detailed service descriptions are available on the URZ website.  

The reusability of research data is largely dependent on the availability and quality of accompanying metadata. Metadata is data about data and provides the context in which the data were created. As a rule of thumb, metadata should answer the classic six questions: Who? What? Why? How? When? Where? Metadata is a prerequisite enabling potential users to find data and assess its suitability for the intended use. Ideally, the description is structured and machine-readable. For this purpose, metadata standards and standardized terminologies exist in most disciplines. If these do not exist, generic standards, such as Dublin Core, MARC, or MODS, should be used.  

In the implementation phase of a project, datasets may evolve over several stages (e.g. by selection, aggregation, integration). It is good practice to label, document and keep the different versions at least for the duration of the project. Especially in the case of text-based data, the use of versioning tools (e.g. git, SVN) helps with the management of different versions.  

In collaborative projects or projects with large amounts of data, the use of dedicated software and infrastructure for data management is advisable. Operating these infrastructures usually requires additional resources, but they provide the advantage of a streamlined central management for research data. Finding and sharing research data is thereby facilitated, but should be governed by a data policy the project consortium agreed upon."""^^xsd:string .

This policy outlines the approach of Glasgow School of Art in relation to research data management and curation.  

Within the context of this policy, research data should be interpreted as any material (whether digital or analogue) that underpins the production of research outputs.  

Research data means data in the form of facts, observations, images, computer program results, recordings, measurements or experiences on which a research output is based. Data may be numerical, descriptive, visual or tactile. It may be raw, cleaned or processed, and may be held in any format or media. Research data in the visual arts mirrors the complexity of the outputs, taking many forms including logbooks, journals, workbooks, sample libraries, sketchbooks, sets of images, video recordings, trials, prototypes, ceramic glaze recipes, found objects, and correspondence. Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument). This metadata facilitates later interpretation and re-use of data.  

Modern research and publishing environments provide increased opportunities to make research data openly available in order to:  

validate research outputs increase and measure impact facilitate knowledge exchange communicate research to wider society  

The Glasgow School of Art recognises that its research data is a key asset that can be managed to maximise benefits to the individual researcher, wider society, our funders and stakeholders, and the School.  """^^xsd:string .

The sound management of research data is essential to high-quality and responsible scholarly research. Hasselt University sees to the quality of the research performed within the institution and by researchers affiliated to the institution. It has already undertaken various initiatives to warrant such high-quality and responsible research, e.g. by subscribing to the Code of Ethics for Scientific Research in Belgium and the European Charter for Researchers, by establishing a Commission on Scientific Integrity, and by drawing up the Integrity Charter. In addition, research data turn out to be key to uphold high-quality research. By implementing a policy plan on research data management Hasselt University aims to manage its research data in the best manner possible.  

This policy plan on research data management at Hasselt University outlines the basic principles and general guidelines for the secure, findable, accessible and understandable preservation, for the management, the reuse (if possible) and the (public) sharing and archiving of research data at Hasselt University for the purpose of (re)use, verification or data collection. It lays down a general framework within which researchers, employees and students at Hasselt University manage their research data in a high-quality manner. These basic principles and general guidelines are based on both national and international developments in the field of research data management, and should be read together with the related regulations and guidelines, as listed in attachment 1 to this policy plan."""^^xsd:string .

Helmholtz Zentrum M√ºnchen, Deutsches Forschungszentrum f√ºr Gesundheit und Umwelt GmbH (hereafter Helmholtz Munich) recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and encourages all scientists to apply the highest standards when handling these data within their projects (for the definition of "research data" see 8.1. 3). This implies that accurate and easily retrievable research data must be an integral part of any research project at the center so that it reflects the scientific culture of our research activities recognized in society and in the scientific community. A generally binding research data policy is not only necessary for the verification and validation of research results, but also forms the basic prerequisite for open, transparent and networked science (Open Science Policy).  

Due to the dynamics of the use of new analytical instruments, research data from current and also from already completed projects can generate additional value for future scientific projects. However, this can only be realized and protected if the data obtained is already protected against loss during the course of the project and if it remains reusable for future projects thanks to its format, the link with corresponding metadata and the assignment of persistent identifiers (DOI). Securing the research data obtained at the center for subsequent use is an essential prerequisite for future innovative (meta)analyses, e.g. to gain new knowledge on the complex interactions between environmental factors and human health."""^^xsd:string .

The need for protection and the exploitation rights of intellectual property (IP) are defined in the employment contract between the researcher and the center as worker or host and are described in detail in the current IP guideline of the center. Copyright and exploitation rights to all forms of intellectual property can be expanded or specified by further agreements (e.g. third-party funding contracts).  

In principle, Helmholtz Munich has the right to decide how research data can be published and shared as a carrier of intellectual property. The treatment of all research data according to the FAIR principles represents the basis for publications and data exchange, but does not enforce the latter. The need for protection of the intellectual property resulting from the research of the center has priority over the exchange of data within the framework of a future open science policy.  

The first use of research data is usually one or more text publication(s) in a journal based on this data. The scope and duration of the initial use can be determined by the scientists in the DMP. In particular, the end of the initial exploitation phase should be determined in a context-dependent and justified manner."""^^xsd:string .

Data sets can be published in two ways:  

A. by simply making them available via a web interface, preferably at a local data repository of Helmholtz Munich,  or via a citable, dedicated  data publication (linked with a DOI). Such a data publication can include the open distribution of the data and metadata, but does not have to.  Instead it can also  show a simple "landing page", which broadly describe the context and content of the data set and via which interested parties can submit a request to the respective decentralized data manager (see above under "Responsibilities and responsibilities") for data release.  

A central technical tool for the publication of research data is a data repository, a server service on which data can be stored by its creators. This data is given a globally unique identifier (e.g. a DOI) and can be searched and, if necessary, downloaded. A restriction of access by the data producer(s) by means of authorization settings is possible depending on the respective repository."""^^xsd:string .

Ownership of data does not exist in Germany. However, copyright guarantees everyone the protection of their intellectual creations.

Both requirements are not regularly met for research data colelcted in routine measurements. Depending on the type of collection, research data can have a level of intellectual creativity that is worthy of protection. In order to ensure legal certainty, it should always be assumed that it is worthy of protection, that is rights of use and exploitation are usually to be clarified contractually with external partners. Careful licensing of published data must also be ensured.  

Regardless of the right to the data obtained, the question of the right of exploitation must be seen.

Research data management covers the entire life cycle of research data, from the creation of a data management plan (DMP) to the collection of primary data, their validation, aggregation to permanent archiving and their publication.  

Research data must be recorded in accordance with the relevant standards of the respective research discipline, stating the tools and methods used to generate and process them. These metadata records contain descriptions of the data context in the long term and to publish them if necessary. Your archiving should be retrievable, readable, exchangeable and reusable according to the four premises of the FAIR data standard (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) (4). The link to their metadata should be made using the established and standardized terminology of the relevant discipline, taking into account the possibility of interdisciplinary reusability and interoperability (5).  

The handling of research data within the framework of defined projects follows the DMP, which is created before the project begins (6). The planned type of research data, its acquisition, storage and access options to the data are to be specified in the DMP and the respective responsible parties are to be named. In the case of technical or methodological changes in the data flow during the course of a project, the DMP must be adapted. In the case of third-party funded projects, the costs incurred for the implementation of the DMP must be taken into account as eligible expenses when applying for funding.

The scope of the intended initial use must be specified in the respective DMP. In the case of contracts with external cooperation partners and guest scientists, care must be taken to ensure that no contractual commitments are entered into that would stand in the way of the publication of results involving the center.

The maintenance of accurate and retrievable data arising from research projects is an essential component of good practice in the conduct of research and a key component of research integrity and research reproducibility. Consideration around research data management and evidence of good research data management should be seen as an integral part of the research process, which is what Aston University expects of all researchers. This is in line with Aston‚Äôs values and commitment to deliver research that changes lives for the better through collaborations between students, academic staff and industry leaders.  

In addition, good research data management can benefit the transparency, productivity and overall reliability of the research generated, supporting the research process and visibility of any research outputs. Evidence of good research data management is also a requirement of most funding bodies and publishers of journal articles. Aston University is committed to supporting its researchers to meet the highest standards of research data management and acknowledges that research data management involves numerous stakeholders across the research data lifecycle, from creation through to dissemination and preservation. Therefore, this policy is divided into distinct sections aimed at key stakeholders within the University.

This policy covers the processes, arrangements, and limitations for storing research data during the active research process.  

For the purposes of this policy, research data are as defined by the UKRI Concordat on Open Research Data1 as ‚Äòthe evidence that underpins the answer to a research question‚Äô. The research data can be quantitative or qualitative and may either be primary (generated first hand) or processed secondary data (building upon primary data) where the rights for the original data may be held elsewhere. Contemporary research data tends to exist digitally and takes many different forms including documents, spreadsheets, code, models, transcripts, images etc. However historic, and visual data can still exist in physical records including books, sketches, photographs, audiotapes, and specimens.  

For a more comprehensive table of research data examples please see Appendix 1.

Kept in a manner that is compliant with legal obligations, University policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies; and   
Considered for long term preservation.  

Clear arrangements for research data management must be in place prior to research data generation. The University recommends that all research projects have an associated Research Data Management plan (RDMP), with named researchers and their responsibilities detailed within. This may be a mandatory requirement as part of a grant application, and your Strategic Funding Manager will advise if so. It is the responsibility of the researcher to consider how legal and ethical restrictions will impact on their ability to share data at the end of the project and it is recommended that these considerations are addressed in a RDMP.  

Research data must be stored and disposed of securely according to the relevant retention and disposal schedule, in accordance with legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements and with particular concern for the confidentiality and security of the data. Records relating to research (e.g. master copies of approved consent forms, information sheets, records relating to ethical approval) should be retained for six years after the date of project closure, in line with the University Records Management Procedures. Research data that underpins published results or is considered to have long-term value should be retained.  

Research data should be stored on Box unless there are specific reasons why this is not practical, nor in line with a collaboration agreement (for example). In this case advice should be sought from Digital Services in the first instance, and the Research Integrity Office where appropriate.  

The deliberate or reckless mismanagement of research data and/or primary materials constitutes unacceptable research conduct and should be reported in line with the University Research Misconduct Policy or the Whistleblowing policy."""^^xsd:string .

In March 2021, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) launched the Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy. This policy seeks to support Canadian research excellence by promoting sound data management and data stewardship practices to ensure ‚Äúthat research makes good use of public funds, experiments and studies are replicable, and research data are available for reuse where ethical, legal, and commercial obligations allow.‚Äù1 The agencies recognize that standards for Research Data Management (RDM) vary across disciplines, areas of research, and modes of scientific and scholarly inquiry.  

The RDM Policy requires all postsecondary institutions and hospitals eligible to administer Tri-Agency funds to develop an institutional research data management (RDM) strategy that reflects the institution‚Äôs size, research intensity, and existing RDM capacity. Additionally, the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, establishes new data management requirements for researchers applying for federal funding. For  certain funding competitions, the agencies will require data management plans (DMPs) to be submitted during the application process. The quality of these plans will be considered in the merit review process. Further, after reviewing the institutional strategies and in step with the readiness of the Canadian research community, the agencies will phase in a data deposit requirement. The RDM policy acknowledges that ‚Äúdetermining what counts as research data, and which data should be preserved, is often highly contextual and should be guided by disciplinary norms.‚Äù2"""^^xsd:string .

Planning data management is essential for every research project and should be an integral part of good research design. Quality research starts with a good DMP. Therefore, for every research project conducted within ITC, a DMP must be written and regularly updated during the project.  

Master students must write a DMP for their research and include it in the documents required for the proposal. The DMP has to be reviewed by the supervisors as part of the proposal‚Äôs assessment. PhD candidates must follow a Data Management Bootcamp (1 ECTS) offered by UT to learn how to write a DMP for their PhD projects. The DMP must be written within the first year of their PhD trajectory, reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward, and included in the documents required for the PhD Qualifier. The DMP for a PhD project must be reviewed annually by the supervisors during the annual interview and updated where necessary. Any other research project must have a DMP before the start of the said project, but no later than four months after the start of the research, and it must be reviewed by the Faculty Data Steward. The DMP has to be reviewed regularly and updated where necessary and it must be adhered to by all research team members.  

A DMP template is available at UT‚Äôs DMP-tool. The template has been accepted by the Dutch Research Council NWO, the independent governmental body Care Research NetherlandsMedical Sciences ZonMW, and the EU (e.g., the European Research Council ERC).

Effective research data management is essential for maintaining the accessibility and security of research data. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for storing data during research. In principle, all research data collected and generated should be stored safely and protected against unauthorised access, accidental disclosure, and loss. The choice of storage facility depends on many factors, such as the type of data, size, the need for collaboration with research partners, etc.  

A copy of key research data (key files of the data collected and generated) and the related materials (e.g. documentation, protocols, models, or questionnaires) must be stored in facilities offered by UT, unless exceptions apply.   
In case researchers wish to use their own storage facilities for primary storage, note that UT has strict requirements when it comes to acquisition of research data storage. It is required to ensure that the storage facility is at least ISO 27001-certified and in the case of health data NEN 7510-certified. These two certificates prove that the way data, especially personal and privacy-sensitive data, are stored complies with current security standards. If you need advice regarding the storage certification, please contact the Faculty ICT Account Manager   
Portable devices (e.g., external hard drives, USB sticks, or personal laptops) should not be used as the primary storage facility of research data.   
Non-digital research data and related materials, such as physical samples, lab notebooks and printed informed consent forms, must be stored in accordance with clearly described procedures and standards within the research group and/or project and must be digitised where possible.  

Take a look at the UT storage decision tree which provides an up-to-date overview of UT storage facilities and all other secure storage solutions offered by UT.

Data sharing refers to providing access to data in a way that maintains the data's availability, accessibility, and confidentiality. This section outlines the best practices and guidelines for data sharing with colleagues within or outside ITC during research.  

Stored research data should be accessible to at least one other member of the research team other than the main researcher, ideally the principal researcher or a daily supervisor for Postdocs, PhDs, and Master students. Access to the stored data by other research team members is vital to ensure data availability. For collaborative projects involving data sharing, a data sharing agreement, which establishes the terms and conditions under which data are shared and clarifies the roles and responsibilities of both parties regarding the management of the data, should be drawn up in consultation with the Faculty Privacy Contact Person and should be signed by the Faculty Dean prior to sharing research data with external parties.  

The UT storage decision tree also offers a range of facilities for data transfer and data   
sharing.   
There are several types of data sharing agreements, depending on the research project and type of data:   
o A data transfer agreement is generally used when sharing non-personal data with third parties;   
o A joint controllership agreement is used to establish shared responsibilities regarding the processing of personal data with collaborators. Consortium agreements and Grant Agreements (e.g., Horizon 2020) provide a legal basis for this type of agreement;   
o A data processing agreement is used when a third party is involved in the processing of personal data on behalf of the data controller (such as collecting, storing, or analysing the data on your behalf);   
o A non-disclosure agreement is typically used for trade or commercial data, including trade secrets and patent-related data."""^^xsd:string .

Data documentation is crucial to ensure that research data are understandable and re-usable by yourself or by others. In accordance with the FAIR principles,  as a minimum requirement a definite version of research data should be well documented. However, best practice is to start documenting data and record metadata early during the research process and to update these regularly throughout research in order to warrant completeness and accuracy.  

Research data, both digital and non-digital, should always be accompanied by metadata to ensure findability and re-usability. Research data must be accompanied by additional documentation (e.g., in the form of a README file, data paper, etc.) to enable correct interpretation and re-use. Clear, concise language and standard terminologies should be used to ensure comprehensibility.  

Research data must be accompanied by at least one set of metadata for the entire dataset. However, for comprehensive documentation, metadata should be provided for each distinct type of data or file where applicable or necessary.   
Since the data repositories provide machine-readable forms of metadata, most often based on a generic metadata standard such as Dublin Core, it is recommended to provide additional documentation in the form of a README file. This documentation should encompass, but not be limited to the data contents and structure, along with all relevant methodological information (e.g., the collection, processing, and quality control aspects of said data), records of different versions of the data files, and details on sharing and access.   
Discipline-specific metadata standards (e.g., the ISO 19115 geographic information metadata standard) can be used to decide on additional information aimed at enhancing the data documentation.   
For the local management of your research datasets and related metadata and for publishing them easily to different research data repositories, you can use the fairly toolset. This toolset includes a command line tool and a JupyterLab extension that facilitate creating, uploading, and downloading research datasets together with metadata without requiring programming skills."""^^xsd:string .

Digital research data that cannot be shared with third parties, including trusted data repositories, must be archived in UT‚Äôs archive facility.   
Research data underlying master's and PhD research projects must be preserved before graduation. Research data underlying other types of research projects must be preserved no later than one month after completion of the research project. Non-digital research data, wherever possible and appropriate, should be digitised. If the data is to be preserved in non-digital format, they should be stored securely in accordance with the respective department‚Äôs common practices.   
The primary author and co-authors of academic publications share the responsibility of controlling access and making any decision with respect to the data and, therefore, should all be acknowledged in the metadata of the archived or published datasets as contact persons.   
For research projects run by ITC researchers, access to the data with restricted access is controlled by the principal investigator. In situations where the original researchers are not available or no longer affiliated with ITC, access to the data is determined and granted by the department chair.   
Archived or published digital and non-digital research data require sufficient documentation to enable proper interpretation and re-use, as described in the section on Data Documentation."""^^xsd:string .

The Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) has committed to promoting open and transparent research practices. Proper Research Data Management (RDM) that is in accordance with FAIR data principles, i.e. ensuring findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable research data, is a key requirement to achieve this mission. Upholding the best research data management practices is essential for fostering efficient, reproducible, transparent, and highquality research.  

Building upon the solid foundation provided by UT's overarching Research Data Management Policy, the policy outlined below provides tailored guidelines and the best practices specific to ITC.  

This ITC-specific policy is intended to ensure that all research data is handled with the utmost care by all ITC researchers and students in order to, among other things:  

Demonstrate academic integrity, upholding transparency and ethical practices in research;   
Safeguard research data security and the privacy of research subjects;   
Enable research reproducibility, allowing for the verification and validation of academic findings;   
Comply with relevant regulations, policies, and Code of Conduct regarding research data management, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), The Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity;

The guidelines shall promote efficient and appropriate handling of research data by providing general information, support and instruction to researchers, heads and other staff responsible for research data management This document was drawn up to meet the requirements of current legislation regarding handling and preserving research data, while also promoting open and accessible research. These guidelines supplement Karlstad University‚Äôs policy on research data management.  

The policy and the guidelines need supplementary documents and instructions guiding the procedures for implementing principles and procedures in the organisation.  

The policy does not cover publishing and utilisation of results or conclusions of research, but applies to the handling of research data collected or created for the purpose of analysis in a research context and serves as the basis for the results and conclusions generated in research. Instructions on publishing and utilisation, as well as detailed information on certain issues briefly described in the guidelines are available in the related document listed under section 9.

Karlstad University is principal research institution and responsible for research data generated by various researchers and research groups at the university.   However, the situation is more complex when it comes to collaboration projects with four principal research institutions. For such projects, agreements regulating the collaboration should as a rule be drawn up, including how research data will be handled in the project.  How to handle research data can also be documented by drawing up a data management plan for the project.  

Research data collected and created at Karlstad University normally belong to the university. If  there are plans to move a research project, or parts of it,  to or from Karlstad University, the  possibilities to transfer, copy or borrow research data should be investigated.9 If research data will be transferred from Karlstad University the National archives must be notified.

    ns1:text """4. Open access to research data  

Open access to research data means that electronic research data and related meta data shall be easily accessible via the internet with as few restrictions as possible. In July 2012, the EU commission recommended the member state to contribute to increased access to research information.  As part of Horizon 2020, further recommendations were issued for open science comprising publications as well as research data. The recommendations were updated in the spring of 2018 and describe how member states should promote sharing research data via national action plans and joint storage solutions, as well as inventive programmes, reward systems and, instruction for researchers.10  

In its research strategic proposition,  "Knowledge in collaboration: for societal challenges and reinforced competitiveness" the Swedish government states that  ‚Äùresearch results, such as research data and research publications generated through publicly funded research should be open and accessible as far as possible.  Certain types of data, however, require restricted access to protect personal integrity, national security, for example.  Openness for research with an innovation potential may need to be restricted for reasons of intellectual property rights.  However, it is an important position that open access is the norm and that restrictions in this regard are exceptions".11  

Karlstad University actively works towards promoting open access to research data according to the EU commission's and the government's recommendations.  Research data which are the result of partly or wholly public funding should without charge make data accessible to further research on condition that there is no legal (e.g. secrecy or rules on personal data handling), ethical, technical or commercial reasons. Access to research data shall, at Karlstad University, follow the principle "as open as possible and as restricted as necessary."  

Certain types of data, however, may not be made accessible, not even with restrictions. For obvious reasons, it is not, for example, permitted to publish confidential information openly on the internet, which means revealing secrets, which is a crime.  This prohibition also applies to research data containing personal data. There are many occasions on which research data may not be made open and accessible, and an assessment must be made in every individual  

Researchers at Karlstad University are responsible for making research data accessible in an appropriate way. There is no requirement that the data should be made accessible before the researchers have published their results. Karlstad University recommends that researchers as a rule make data accessible in an established data repositorium ‚Äì‚Äì completely open or with restrictions based on assessment of appropriateness ‚Äì‚Äì  with data citation requirements."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """5. FAIR principles  

The FAIR principles12  (F - Findable, A - Accessible, I - Interoperable, R - Reusable) play an important part in efforts towards open science.  They describe some of the most central guidelines for sound data management and open access to electronic research data.  Research data do not need be in digital form originally, but efficient accessibility and FAIR implementation require data in digital form.  The FAIR principles were published for the first time in 2016 and since then the EU and a number of research funders, universities and research infrastructures have endorsed them. In Sweden,  the Research Council and the Royal Library have the government's mandate to develop criteria for assessing the extent to which research data and scholarly publications meet the FAIR principles.13 Altogether, FAIR comprises 15 principles which can be applied to research in all disciplines.  

Handling digital research data at Karlstad University should follow the international FAIR principles to the extent it is practicable.  Karlstad University strives to make research data with related meta data findable, accessible and reusable for new research purposes long-term, which generally means several generations of the hard and software required for the processing.  

However, it is important to note that the FAIR principles do not entail that digital research data should always be open and accessible to everyone. Research ethical assessments, information provided to research participants, personal data protection legislation, and secrecy are factors that always warrant attention before research data can be made accessible beyond the research group, as described under section 5 above."""^^xsd:string .

According to the ethics review act,4 research refers to ‚Äùscientific experimental or theoretical work designed to obtain new knowledge and research-based development projects, excluding projects carried out as part of undergraduate or master level studies‚Äù.  

The term principal research institution  refers, according to the ethics review act, to ‚Äùa public authority or physical or legal body in whose organisation the research is carried out.‚Äù  

According to the National Archives‚Äô general directives on deletion of research-related documents in public authorities,5 a research project is defined as ‚Äùa research activity delimited in time and purpose related to a certain assignment and/or certain persons.‚Äù A research project can comprise several sub projects and can be externally or internally funded.  

In terms of these guidelines, research data can refer to all forms of stored data collected or created to be analysed for research purposes and on which results and conclusions generated through the research are based. Some examples of research data are statistics and measuring data, transcribed interviews and questionnaire answers, results of experiments, field study observations, audio-video recorded interviews and visual images/art.  

The term meta data refers in these guidelines to a structured description of research data, i.e. ‚Äúdata about data‚Äù. Meta data can consist of a descriptive or contextual information on the provenance of data, such as how variables are defined, how data are structured, how various data sets are related, information on  how and by whom the data were collected or if a special software was used to read or analyse the data.  

The term data citation refers, in these guidelines, to the practice of referring to research data in the same way that researchers provide references to journal articles, reports, conference contribution and other publications."""^^xsd:string .

Generally speaking, this also applies to research data collected or created at Karlstad University.  

The right to request documents is, however, restricted in two ways.

It is also important to ensure that personal data are handled in a secure way and that no more people than those authorised have access to the data.  

If  sensitive personal data (article 9 GDPR) or information of criminal offences (article 10 GDPR) are treated for research purposes, also the rules stipulated in legislation pertaining to ethical review of research on humans must be considered.

Information security involves protecting information against various forms of threat by adapting the technical, physical and administrative environments in which the information is handled. With regard to the delicacy of information and the risks involved in the handling, Karlstad University has a general responsibility for implementing appropriate technical and organisational protective measures to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the information is handled appropriately and in compliance with current legislation.  

Research data must therefore be handled to ensure that information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), erroneous changes (accuracy), and that the information is accessible when needed  (accessibility). It is also important to make sure that the information cannot be changed, requested by or provided to any unauthorised persons (traceability).  

The two most important measures for achieving appropriate information security for research data is either to classification of information to be treated (i.e. completely insignificant information, sensitive information,  personal data, sensitive personal data or confidential information), or to use the IT resources available for the purpose at Karlstad University.

These Procedures also include requests for the provision of any CCTV footage2.  

Personal information held by the University is managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act 2018 (the Act) and the University‚Äôs Data Protection Policy3.  The Act and the University‚Äôs Policy provide guidance on the circumstances when it is lawful to disclose and transfer personal information outside the University and in general this should be carried out ‚Äúfairly and lawfully‚Äù and in accordance with the University‚Äôs Data Protection Notification.  

There are, however, exemptions within the Act which allow the University, under strict guidelines, to release information to law enforcement agencies without the consent of the individual whose information is being released, and regardless of the purpose for which the information was originally collected.  

In particular personal information may be released if:  

the information is required for safeguarding national security failure to provide the information would prejudice the prevention or detection of crime, the apprehension or prosecution of offenders or the assessment or collection of any tax or duty  

Personal information may also be disclosed without contravening the terms of the Act where that disclosure is required by law.  

Before the University releases any information to a law enforcement agency it must satisfy itself that the disclosure is necessary and required for a legitimate purpose.  

The University seeks to co-operate with the police and with other agencies in the prevention and detection of crime and these Procedures set out the steps to be followed when responding to requests for personal information from these external agencies.

1. Management of data is an essential part of good research practice and all researchers in the University have an obligation to record, store and archive their data appropriately.  This brings with it the assurance that data supporting publications are available for analysis and will enable access by other researchers who could use the data, thus maximising the effectiveness of our research funding. The precise requirements of this and the procedures that should be used is a very complex issue when considering the wide range of information generated in research.  Thus the primary responsibility for research data management lies with individual researchers, and it is these staff who need to consider each individual project, whether it is appropriate to archive data and exactly what data should be stored.  However, this policy sets out our expectations, support and processes that are aimed at ensuring that research data from Lancaster is managed in the best possible way.

Research:  The HEFCE definition of research in relation to the REF is:  ‚ÄòResearch‚Äô is understood as original investigation undertaken in order to gain knowledge and understanding.  It includes work of direct relevance to the needs of commerce, industry, and to the public and voluntary sectors; scholarship [\\*]; the invention and generation of ideas, images, performances, artefacts including design, where these lead to new or substantially improved insights; and the use of existing knowledge in experimental development to produce new or substantially improved materials, devices, products and processes, including design and construction.  It excludes routine testing and routine analysis of materials, components and processes such as for the maintenance of national standards, as distinct from the development of new analytical techniques.  It also excludes the development of teaching materials that do not embody original research.  

Research Data:   This is not easy to define in a comprehensive way it is therefore important for each researcher to consider this in detail in the context of their own project.  To give a broad view the University of Melbourne uses the following definition:  ‚ÄúResearch Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument, theory or test is based.  Data may be numerical, descriptive or visual.  Data may be raw or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data includes:  laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.  Provenance information about the data might also be included: the how, when, where it was collected and with what (for example, instrument).  The software code used to generate, annotate or analyse the data may also be included‚Äù.

## Introduction  

Leeds Trinity University recognises that good research demands good data management in the support of academic integrity, openness and good stewardship. It will ensure that research data is managed to high standards throughout the research data lifecycle.  

The effective management of Research Data will help us to:  

meet the requirements of our funders   
recognise the value and impact of our research data, to ourselves and others   
improve the visibility of and our reputation for research and create opportunities for further research collaboration   
encourage open enquiry and allow results to be independently tested, improving the overall quality of research.  

## Definition of Research Data  

Research data means information in digital, computer-readable format or paper based that:  

is contained or presented in various ways including notes, facts, figures, tables, images (still and moving), audio or visual recordings; and   
which is collected, generated or obtained during the course of or as a result of undertaking research (which includes but is not limited to   
conducting field or laboratory experiments, conducting trials, surveys, interviews, focus groups or analysis of data); and   
which is subsequently used by the researcher as a basis for making calculations or drawing conclusions to develop, support or revise theories, practices and findings.  

This policy encompasses data from research that has the potential for publication, regardless of whether or not the research is funded. It applies to research carried out by academic staff and Postgraduate Researchers, but is unlikely to apply to Undergraduate research except in exceptional circumstances.

Leibniz University Hannover adopts the DFG's definition of research data, which includes, among others, the following types of data: ‚Äúmeasurement data, laboratory results, audiovisual information, texts, survey data, objects from collections, or samples [‚Ä¶]. Methodical forms of testing such as questionnaires, software and simulations may also [‚Ä¶] be categorised as research data.‚Äù4  

Research-data management ensures the accessibility, re-use, reproducibility and quality of research findings. It includes both the planning and the implementation of a process for the handling of research data. The cross-linking of research data with metadata throughout the research process ensures that data can be easily located and reused.

2. Leibniz University Hannover requests that its researchers store, archive and publish research data in subject-specific repositories or in the university's existing institutional infrastructure ‚Äì provided that this complies with legal and ethical requirements. This ensures that research data is freely accessible to the public, in accordance with the Leibniz University Hannover Open Access Policy.7, 8 At a minimum, research data should be freely available for scientific use, and to ensure reusability it should be assigned an open licence.9 The citation should likewise be assigned a persistent identifier, e.g. DOI (digital object identifier). Leibniz University Hannover recommends that its researchers use CC0 or CC BY licences to enable the extensive reuse of their work. This is in accordance with the requirements of the funding bodies as well as the FAIR data principles.   
3. Leibniz University Hannover advises its researchers to develop internal institute and/or project guidelines which establish detailed rules for handling research data. Researchers should also systematically draft and implement data management plans within the scope of project planning.

is then also important that the research data is preserved and is findable. Externally funded   
research projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8.

1.1 This policy applies to all individuals conducting research or carrying out related duties on behalf of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), including those based at the MRC Unit The Gambia at LSHTM and the MRC/UVRI and LSHTM Uganda Research Unit. This includes, but is not limited to, employed and honorary staff, research students and visiting academics. It is expected that all collaborative research partners should be made aware of this policy. The group to whom the policy applies are referred to collectively in this document as ‚ÄòResearchers‚Äô.  

1.2 LSHTM expects the principles set out in this policy to be understood, observed, and followed by all researchers.  

1.3 Where research is undertaken as part of a research project, primary responsibility for ensuring compliance rests with the senior researcher, typically the Principal Investigator (PI) or Supervisor. Responsibility may be delegated to a named researcher as necessary.  

1.4 Where research is conducted with other institutions and/or external researchers, LSHTM researchers are responsible for the management of research data that are under their own control. If the senior researcher is not a member of LSHTM, LSHTM researchers should make their collaborators aware of the policy to facilitate compliance.  

1.5 If all researchers associated with the research have left LSHTM, responsibility for compliance will devolve upwards, resting with the Head of Department in the first instance.  

1.6 Exemption to specific principles may be granted in circumstances where compliance will breach legislative, regulatory, contractual, ethical, and/or other obligations. Such cases should be discussed with the Research Data Manager within Library, Archive & Open Research Services (LAORS) in the first instance. The decision will be escalated to the Research Governance Committee in more complex cases."""^^xsd:string .

Research data that substantiate research findings should be shared through a managed repository or enclave in a manner that is compatible with the ethical, legal, contractual, and/or other requirements that apply to research.  

Research data suitable for sharing should be made available within 12 months of the grant closure or at the point when research findings based on the work are published, whichever is sooner. Funder policies and community practices that stipulate more rapid sharing supersede this requirement.  

Access mechanisms applied to research data must comply with good research practice and conditions that apply to the research. Open access is encouraged where possible. However, controls upon access and use may be applied where necessary to fulfil ethical, legal, contractual or other requirements.  

Researchers should take appropriate steps to identify and address barriers that may limit the ability to share research data. This may include ensuring that ethics and contractual documents recognise the need to share data with others, developing procedures and allocating resources to prepare data for sharing.  

An exemption may be sought for research data covered by ethical, legal, contractual, or other conditions that prohibit sharing. Researchers that have not obtained explicit consent to share data within participant informed consent forms and/or collaboration agreements and who are subsequently required to make data available should seek advice from the Research Governance & Integrity Office and/or the Research Data Manager.

Data Access Statement: A statement provided in published research that describes where research assets that underpin the paper are hosted, how they may be accessed, and any conditions of access and use.   
Data Management Plan (DMP): A document that describes how research data and/or other research assets will be obtained, managed and shared during the research lifecycle and following its completion.  

Digital repository: A system for storing, managing and sharing research assets, such as data and code. LSHTM Data Compass is an example of an institutional digital repository.  

Metadata: Information that describes one or more research assets. Metadata may describe the content of a research asset, how it was obtained, and how it may be accessed and used.  

Non-Exclusive Licence: A licence that grants the same rights to several licensees. This differs from an exclusive licence, which assigns rights to a specific licensee, to the exclusion of others.  

Persistent Identifier (PID): A unique, stable, permanent reference to a digital object. Examples include the Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCiD) system to identify authors, and Digital Object Identifier (DOIs) system applied to journal articles and datasets.  

Principal Investigator: The lead researcher or scientist for a project.  

Researcher: Any person conducting research or involved in the creation, collection, or generation of research data for or on behalf of LSHTM. This may include, but not be limited to, employed staff, research students, and honorary staff.  

Research Asset: A resource produced as part of the research process. This includes research data, code, scripts, collection tools, participant consent forms, and other resources.  

Research Funder: An agency responsible for the financial support of research activities.  

Research Project: A unit of work performed by one or more researchers that has been established for the purpose of addressing specific aims and objectives.  

Retention Period: The time period for which the research data must be kept. The LSHTM Records Retention & Disposal Schedule states research data must be retained for a minimum of 10 years following project completion, with the recognition that third-party requirements that have a longer retention period will take precedent."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """3.1. LSHTM-led research projects working with research data must create a Data Management Plan  

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a formal document that outlines how research assets, such as data, code, and other support material, will be obtained, managed and shared during the research lifecycle and following its completion. It outlines how the researcher will address requirements that apply to the research and steps that will be taken to ensure it can be verified and reused.  

LSHTM-led research projects working with research data must prepare a Data Management Plan (DMP) before the commencement of research, even if not required by their research funder.  

A Data Management Plan should be written at the appropriate stage:  

Public/private funded research should prepare a Data Management Plan prior to submission of a research application or within the first 3 months of project funding, as required by the funder.   
PhD/DrPH students should agree a Data Management Plan with their Supervisor and submit it as part of their Upgrading or Review Report.   
Researchers that are unfunded, working with 3rd party data only, performing consultancy, undertaking an MSc project solely in pursuit of a qualification are encouraged to prepare Data Management Plan, but are not covered by this mandate.  

It is advisable to develop a Data Management Plan in conjunction with other relevant documents, such as the research plan/protocol and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), where appropriate.  

All researchers associated with a research project must be made aware of and abide by the Data Management Plan.  

The Data Management Plan should be reviewed and updated at appropriate stages during the research lifecycle. It is recommended that it is reviewed and updated when significant changes are made to the project work plan or every six months, as a minimum.  

Funder-specific templates and guidance for writing a Data Management Plan should be followed, where applicable. If no funder template exists, LSHTM provides templates that may be used (see Related Policies & Procedures)."""^^xsd:string .

Researchers should clarify intellectual property rights and custodianship for research data and other research assets that are used in research at the earliest opportunity. This will ensure that it can be collected, stored, managed and shared in compliance with relevant conditions that apply to research. This includes ethical, legal, regulatory, contractual, and/or other requirements.  

The rights of research participants to engage with decision-making is recognized as important for ensuring they benefit from work undertaken, in line with guidelines such as the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance. Research participants must be provided with sufficient information to understand and influence how their information will be stored, analysed and shared as part of the research process. Guidance may be found in the LSHTM Standard Operating Procedure on Informed Consent (LSHTM-SOP-005) and relevant SOPs at the respective MRC Units in Gambia and Uganda.  

Research partners should agree on a collaboration agreement that clearly indicates the rights they possess and permissions they provide to ensure research data can be used for current and future research. Rights will often be owned by the host institution(s) in which researchers are based, rather than the researcher themselves, therefore it is important that this agreement is reviewed and approved by the relevant institution‚Äôs legal team. Advice on preparing collaboration agreements and sample templates can be obtained from the LSHTM Legal Services Office.  

Exclusive rights to ownership or use of research data should not be handed over to a third party, unless it is a condition imposed by contractual or other obligations, without first consulting the Research Data Manager or LSHTM Legal Services Office for advice. Instead, researchers are encouraged to apply a non-exclusive licence that enables research data to be accessed and used by many parties.

A minimum retention period longer than 10 years may be specified by third parties for specific types of research. For instance, research data produced as part of a clinical trial must be kept for a minimum of 25 years. Similarly, research data that underpins published research findings must often be made available for a minimum of 10 years after the date that it was published, in accordance with journal requirements.  

Data provided by a third party that contains a contractual condition that it is held for a shorter time period are exempt from this requirement.  

A decision to dispose of research data or other research assets under the researcher‚Äôs control may be made after the retention period has passed, in consultation with relevant staff. Appropriate documentation should be maintained on any research assets that are selected for disposal, in compliance with guidance outlined in the LSHTM Records Retention and Disposal Schedule and its supporting documents.

#### Researchers‚Äô responsibilities  

Responsibility for the creation of a research data management plan, the updating of that plan (where necessary), and the implementation of that plan throughout the research lifecycle during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs). Heads of Departments and Centres and others responsible for research staff and students should ensure that researchers in their areas are aware of the University‚Äôs policy regarding research data management and its associated guidelines and procedures.  

Researchers are required to comply with the conditions of their of their research funders‚Äô data policies.   
Researchers should ensure published results always include information on how to access the supporting data.   
PIs should review their data holdings assessing their research value e.g. for potential future use in research and education, and wider applications for policy, commerce or public interests.   
PIs should notify the University of their data holdings and supply the Data Asset Register (currently the University data repository) with metadata relating to their data.  

### University‚Äôs responsibilities  

The University will provide access to training, support, advice and, where appropriate, guidelines and templates for research data management and research data management plans.   
The University will provide access to mechanisms and services for storage, backup, registration, valuation, deposit and retention of research data assets in support of current and future access, during and after completion of research projects.   
The University reserves the right to appraise and review its data holdings in consultation with PIs and appropriate experts.   
This policy will be reviewed and updated through the Research Committee in consultation with appropriate stakeholders.  

### Relationship with existing policies  

Research data will be managed in accordance with the University‚Äôs other policies and guidelines, such as:

1.3 The benefits of opening up research data for scrutiny and reuse are potentially very significant; including economic growth, increased resource efficiency, securing public support for research funding and increasing public trust in research. However, openness requires more  

1.4 than disclosure of data. All those engaged with research have a responsibility to ensure that the data they gather and generate is properly managed, accessible, intelligible, and usable by others unless there are legitimate reasons to the contrary2.

UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) defines research data as 'the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital or physical).  

These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Data may be raw or primary (e.g. direct from measurement or collection) or derived from primary data for subsequent analysis or interpretation (e.g. cleaned up or as an extract from a larger data set), or derived from existing sources where the rights may be held by others.  

Data may be defined as 'relational' or 'functional' components of research, thus signalling that their identification lies in whether and how researchers use them as evidence for claims.  

They may include, for example, statistics, collections of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.3  

Manchester Metropolitan University recognises three main states for research data:  

Active research data (e.g. live digital project data in the research data storage platform) Archived research data (e.g. ‚Äòfinished‚Äô / ‚Äòend of project‚Äô data prepared for long-term preservation. This may contain sensitive personal information. This is archived for legal, regulatory or contractual purposes and is not publicly accessible) Reusable research data (e.g. a dataset that has been made findable, sharable and available for reuse through the most appropriate repository / data archive. This is subject to ethical, legal  

and contractual requirements)

Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.  

Principal investigator is the most senior researcher associated with the research and the primary. individual responsible for the research project implementation, management and integrity of the design, conduct, and reporting. Additionally, the Pl holds the responsibility for the direction and oversight of compliance.  

Researchers refers to all members of an institution including employed scientists students and support staff as well as others with a formal affiliation at [name of research institution], who have access to, generate and/or manage research data.Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.  

Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development results observations or findings of a research project,including contextual information. Research data include all materials that are created in the course of academic work, including digitization, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews.. This includes methods/protocols, metadata, software and code.Research data can take on several forms: during the lifespan of a research project, data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), shared data, published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data,restricted data and closed data.  

Metadata [17] is data providing information about data that makes findable, trackable and (re)usable. It can include information such as contact information, geographic locations, details about units of measure,abbreviations or codes used in the dataset, instrument and protocol information,survey tool details, provenance and version information and much more.  

Data sharing is the practice of making scientific data used for scholarly research available to others, for research re-use or in knowledge transfer activities (e.g.researchers, institutions,the broader public).

Research data management is the planning, capture, review, publication, storage, preservation and re-use of data produced by research, irrespective of format.  

The University views effective research data management as an essential ingredient of a high quality research culture.   
It assumes that all data produced by University researchers will be made available to the wider academic community, except where the right of individual researchers, or the subjects of the research, would be compromised by such release.   
The University provides training, support, advice and information to support effective research data management.   
Research data management is a shared responsibility. Individual researchers, academic units and central departments work together to develop research data management plans and implement them throughout the research life cycle.   
All research proposals include an integral research data management plan.   
The University actively supports the collection, storage, retention and cataloguing of all its research data (both raw and published) and promotes its re-use by other researchers where appropriate and with due safeguards.   
Research data management policies safeguard the interests of participants in the research, the researchers and the University by facilitating compliance with relevant legislation.   
All research data is stored securely and is registered with the University. Data is stored in the data centres of higher educational institutions or in subject-specific data services.   
All University policies, including those on Intellectual Property, Good Research Practice and the Procedures for Investigation of Research Misconduct, support good practice in research data management.

The Medical University of Graz (Med Uni Graz) recognises the fundamental importance of research data management, including the importance of maintaining the accompanying records, to ensure high-quality research and scientific integrity. It strives to promote the highest standard in this regard in accordance with the FAIR principles. Accurate, easily retrievable and traceable research data are a fundamental and integral part of any scientific research activity. These data are also essential in that they allow research processes and results to be reviewed and defended, among other things. Research data are of lasting value to research and teaching, opening up the potential for their broad use by members of society.  

Research data shall be handled exclusively in accordance with the applicable national and international legal provisions.  

Due to the diversity of research data and processes, it is not possible to define uniform guidelines for the management of research data in detail (e.g. with regard to file structures, repositories, software, metadata). In addition, both the requirements and data management systems develop differently and extremely dynamically in specific research areas. For these reasons, this policy establishes general principles that are independent of research topics and will be continuously adapted as a living document to take into account current developments."""^^xsd:string .

Research data and their metadata must be kept accurately, completely and reliably in accordance with good scientific practice to ensure the traceability of these data. Furthermore, efforts must be made to ensure the identifiability, findability, availability and, wherever possible, re-usability and interoperability of these data. If possible, the data should be given permanent identifiers.  

Records need to be kept of the methodology used to obtain the data, their processing (such as corrections, calculations, transformations, statistical analyses) and quality control measures. These records are considered as part of the data and should be archived together with these (metadata).  

The retention period for research data and records is ‚Äì unless other legal regulations apply - dated least ten years either from the date of publishing the research results or, if no publication takes place, from the date of completing the relevant research activity. Justified deviations may result from the legal regulations (e.g. patent law, pharmaceutical law, requirements for the documentation of patient care), the requirements of third-party funding providers, or specific guidelines issued by the Rectorate.  

If research data and records are deleted or destroyed, this must be done in accordance with all legal and internal university requirements and in consideration of the aspect of traceability. The interests of other stakeholders (e.g. funding bodies) as well as aspects of confidentiality and security must be taken into account.  

Research data management must be organised at each organisational unit to ensure that individual persons can find and access certain data but also to guarantee the findability and accessibility of the data, even in the absence of individual persons involved in the research process. In justified cases and in accordance with good scientific practice, it must be ensured that direct access (e.g. for managers, project leaders) or indirect access (e.g. for co-authors of joint manuscripts/publications, project partners, research-supporting institutions, authorities) can be granted to relevant original data.

According to the definition in the Ethics Review Act (Act on Ethics Review of Human Research (SFS 2003:460)), research principal is a government agency or a natural or legal person in whose activities the research is carried out. It is the research principal who, together with the individual researcher, is legally responsible for ensuring that the activities comply with the rules of the Ethics Review Act. In addition to the responsibility for data management Mid Sweden University is a public authority with archival responsibility.  

Archiving legislation constitutes a mandatory legal framework and deals with issues relating to the preservation and deletion of documents at a public authority. It is also the higher education institution that assesses whether certain data should be disclosed upon request in accordance with the principle of public access to official records. Data protection legislation means additional responsibility for the higher education institution in the handling of research data containing personal data.  

Research data collected at Mid Sweden University belongs, as a general rule, to the university and the university therefore has the principal responsibility for data.  

There may be exceptions to the university¬¥s property rights as a result of copyright rules. A document containing data relating to a work protected by copyright may nevertheless be subject to archiving liability, while at the same time subject to copyright protection. The university must consider copyright when applicable."""^^xsd:string .

Mid Sweden University does not claim patent rights or any other intellectual property rights relating to the results of the research. The researcher is not expected to make research data available until the results of the research are published.

    ns1:text """Making research data accessible according to FAIR  

In what degree research data can be made open access or not is a case-bycase assessment. The assessment may be influenced by provisions in law and by research ethical considerations and carried out in consultation with the DAU function. Such an assessment is made before data have been collected and should be documented in a data management plan for each project.  

A funder may require that research data be published openly available to grant applications for research funding, a funder may also have requested that data be treated confidentially. If such an agreement exists, data cannot be made open until any time embargo has expired. Such an agreement does not necessarily affect the possibility for someone to request data based on the principle of public access. In order to deny disclosure of a document or part of a document (data) upon request, the information must be protected by secrecy according in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (SFS 2009:400).  

Data can be made accessible to varying degrees and still considered to be handled according to the FAIR principles. When data is confidential under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, only metadata can be made available during the period of confidentiality. In other projects, aggregated data may be published openly, while raw data may only be released upon request. There are also projects where all data can and should be open access. It is possible to choose between different levels of accessibility for sharing data. The researcher, in consultation with the project leader, is responsible together with the DAU to indicate the appropriate level. Some examples of reasons why research data cannot be made open access are that it contains personal data, is subject to confidentiality under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, is security protected or that there are ethical aspects that prevent open access to data."""^^xsd:string .

Information security is about protecting information from various types of threats, such as transparency from unauthorised persons or distortion of information. In accordance with the FAIR principles, research data shall be as open as possible but as closed as necessary while protecting all data from leaking, distorting or destroying. A security system for data protection consists of three different parts: a technical, a physical and an organizational. The three parts shall complement each other and create a secure system.  

Research data shall be handled in such a way as to ensure that the information is protected against unauthorised access (confidentiality), inaccurate changes (property), and that the information is accessible when needed (accessibility). It is also important to ensure that the information is not altered, sought, or disclosed to anyone who is not authorised to consult it.  

Information classification is an important part of achieving good information security for your research data. The information classification is crucial for which storage space can be used for the management of research data.

A data management plan is a document that aims to describe in a structured way the management of research data in a project. The data management plan should cover all phases of the project from planning and collecting, creating, or generating data, to analysis, publishing and archiving. The plan makes it easier to keep track of your data during the project and can also make it easier to comply with the FAIR principles. In addition, the data management plan may facilitate the preparation of an ethical review application.

Middlesex University is committed to supporting and facilitating research excellence. Excellent research is underpinned by high quality data and as such it is essential that research conducted within the institution be subject to Research Data Management (RDM) best practice. Supporting the principles of the Universities UK concordat to support research integrity' and the Middlesex University Code of Practice for Research,? it is the institution's responsibility to encourage and enable researchers to engage with this best practice.  

The benefits of managing research data effectively include:  

Improving the integrity, longevity and utility of research data   
Mitigating the risk of accidental data loss   
Enabling data sharing and re-use, increasing the visibility, impact and integrity of research.   
Mitigating the risk of inappropriate release of sensitive data.   
Ensuring appropriate long term preservation of and access to data.  

Research Councils UK (RcUK) expect that "publicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property [while recognising] that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data."3  

Individual funding councils such as Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPsRc)' and Economic and Social Research Council (EsRc)' have updated research data policy statements to set out responsibilities of both the individual researcher and research institutions.

This document outlines the overall policy of the University and its expectations of its staff and key services. More detailed practical help and information can be found on the ‚ÄòResearch Data oolkit‚Äô website:    

olicy Principles 1. The project Principal Investigator (PI) at Newcastle University has overall responsibility for the appropriate storage, treatment (including making data sets suitable for publication) and security of research project data. PIs may delegate discrete responsibilities to other members of the project team and this should be recorded. 2. All research projects are encouraged to create a data management plan at the earliest practical stage of a project. The plan should outline a project‚Äôs approach to data, including costs and be reviewed regularly to ensure that practice remains in-line with expected standards. 3. All University staff are responsible for making themselves familiar with and adhering to legislation, funder guidance and University policy governing their research data. 4. The University expects that data (particularly personal data) be protected in line with both external and internal standards and discipline specific practice. The PI has responsibility for ensuring the safeguarding of personal identifiable research data and compliance with all relevant legal requirements. 5. Researchers should deposit all significant archive research data in an appropriate funder mandated or discipline specific data repository. Where this is not available, data should be deposited in an approved centre / manner. 6. Published datasets should be comprehensive and have clear instructions for access, which adheres to data citation principles. Metadata (descriptive information) should be rich enough to facilitate discovery, reproduction and reuse. Personal data should be protected in line with the University‚Äôs Ethics Policy and Code of Good Practice. 7. Research data should remain available for 10 years following any publication (unless otherwise specified) after which retention will be reviewed. Metadata will be kept indefinitely. 8. Non-digital data or digital data that underpins a publication should be recorded in the University‚Äôs data catalogue as a metadata record. 9. The University undertakes to provide appropriate resources, training, support and guidance to researchers and research support staff around data management and data governance. Where appropriate, the University will also provide a mechanism to record research metadata and to manage access. 10. Where research data has a commercial value or supports a commercial output such as a patent then public disclosure of the data may be delayed (this should be agreed in consultation with Research Strategy and Development)."""^^xsd:string .

Security-sensitive materials in this case can be defined as:- a) Those which are covered by the Official Secrets Act (1989) and the Terrorism Act 2006. b) Materials which could be considered ‚Äòextremist‚Äô or incompatible with British values.  

The University supports both its academic faculty and student body in undertaking research utilising security sensitive materials but takes seriously its responsibility to protect them both from the potentially radicalising effects of viewing materials of this type and of misinterpretation of intent by authorities (which may result in legal sanction).

1. Does the research involve the viewing, usage or transfer of Sensitive personal data as defined as by the Data Protection Act 1998, Terrorism Act (2006) or data governed by statute such as the Official Secrets Act, commercial contract or by convention e.g. client confidentiality?

The downloading of (particularly terrorism related) security-sensitive materials and visiting of security-sensitive websites can be seen by the authorities as prosecutable offences should the intent behind them be illegal.  

Research material which is security sensitive should not be kept on the researcher‚Äôs personal computer or on their standard University drive. Before beginning the research, a member of NUITs Information Security Team should be contacted, they will arrange for the set-up of an appropriately secure project drive. Material within this drive will be easy to access but in some cases there will may restrictions preventing its exchange.  

Likewise if the research involves visiting security-sensitive websites, the researcher should be aware that many of these sites are under surveillance by the authorities. It is strongly recommended that their University profile (IP address) is used to access these sites, thereby ensuring that their activities are flagged as being a legitimate part of their research and ensure that enquiries come to the institution in the first instance.  

Physical data, e.g. manuals / reports should be scanned and a copy uploaded to the secure project file store.  

By using a secure file store (along with appropriate ethics approval) the researcher will ensure that, should the University be asked, it can confirm that the materials within it are for research.

The effective management of research data is becoming increasingly important.  UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) has affirmed that making research data available to users is a core part of its remit.  UKRI‚Äôs Common Principles on Data Policy1 states that ‚ÄòPublicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property.‚Äô  

Northumbria University recognises that data from its research should be wellmanaged to benefit the researcher, the University and the wider community.  As such, there is an obligation to record, store and archive research data appropriately, in a way that is proportionate in terms of security and retention, and allows for sharing of data to contribute to the impact of the research.  It is recognised that types of data used, collected and generated will vary between different disciplines. The approach taken in this policy is to be sensitive to these differences while ensuring that good practice is promoted and funder requirements are met.  

This policy should be read in conjunction with other University policies, notably the Records Management Policy2, the Research Ethics and Governance Handbook3, and the Data Protection Policy4."""^^xsd:string .

## 1  Background  

A 2008 HEFCE-funded report defines research data as ‚Äúthe evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work.‚Äù Data management, including planning for long-term storage and sharing, is an increasingly important aspect of the UK Research funding environment. Most grant applications for research which will generate digital data sets require a data management plan that meets the 2011 Research Councils UK (RCUK) policy; this states that: ‚ÄòPublicly funded research data are a public good, produced in the public interest, which should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner that does not harm intellectual property:‚Äô   
   

As of May 2012, RCUK required all funded universities to have a data management policy and road map in place, that will be fully implemented by 2015 to meet their expectations for data sharing, as follows:  

publicly funded research data should be made openly available in a timely manner;   
data with acknowledged long term value should be made accessible;   
RCUK recognises that there are legal, ethical and commercial constraints on release of research data. To ensure that the research process is not damaged by inappropriate release of data, research organisation policies and practices should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process;   
Research Council funded work may be entitled to a limited period of privileged use of the data.  

A summary of funder data management/sharing requirements can be found here:

The requirement is that both raw and derived data, as well as the software scripts used for the full data processing chain, that produce the final figures or tables of a publication are published in a trusted data repository such as 4TU.ResearchData or Zenodo.org (also coined as Level 1 data by Quantum Nanoscience department2) no later than the publication of a peer reviewed research article or submission of a traditional research article to a preprint archive (e.g. to arXiv.org). Additionally, the required research data also needs to be made available for the review process of said article through the journal or a data repository. Note that publication of data should be under an as open as possible license3. It is also highly encouraged to record the version of all software components used in generation, analysis or processing of data. Moreover, it is required to deposit code which has been used in the analysis or processing of data together with the published dataset (see also TU Delft Research Software Policy4 for more details on publication of code/software).   
Note that deposition (in public data repositories) of datasets not directly linked with publications is not required but encouraged if the data can possibly be used for other scopes than initially intended.   
Should data which underlies publications, because of valid reasons (e.g. to protect IP sensitive data) not be made available in a public repository, it should be ensured that the data management plan and any research publications resulting from the project have a statement explaining what additional datasets/materials exists; why access is restricted; who can use the data and under what circumstances.

    pt:describes pt:Topic_15 ;
    ns1:text """Preamble  

Good research data management (RDM) is important for several reasons. To begin with, ensuring research integrity requires that research results are verifiable. This verifiability requires the findability and accessibility of research data.  

Secondly, findable and accessible research data enable other researchers to reproduce or replicate research, where possible. This, in turn, contributes to the quality of scientific research.  

Thirdly, the effective management of research data contributes to the potential of its reuse. Making research data findable, accessible and understandable to other researchers contributes to the possibility of using these research data again, in other research. This encourages the efficient and effective use of research resources.  

The fourth reason why research data should be properly managed is that it improves the prospects for the recognition and accountability of research. Datasets are increasingly being recognised as stand-alone research outputs, and when properly archived and registered this information can be more adequately considered in the assessment and evaluation of research.  

A fifth aspect of importance is privacy. The effective management of research data is necessary for ensuring that any privacy-sensitive information that is collected in the context of scientific research is adequately processed, stored and archived. In this respect, RDM also contributes to ethically responsible research.  

Finally, there is also the fact that RDM is becoming more and more important in national and international research policy, and that research funding bodies and scientific journals are increasingly imposing requirements with respect to the archiving and accessibility of research data. This is another reason why the archiving and registration of research data needs to be organised properly.  """^^xsd:string .

RGU recognises that good research is underpinned and validated by good data. Research data provides the evidence of academic endeavours and in conjunction with publications, forms an important part of the scholarly record. Research data is a valuable asset and good management of research data brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. All researchers at RGU create or use some type of data as part the research process.

Responsible handling of research data provides a clear indication that the institution and individual researchers are operating with integrity.

Sharing research data appropriately enhances the value and impact of research, therefore, RGU supports:

the UkRl position that publicly funded research data is a public good and that it should be made openly available with as few restrictions as possible in a timely and responsible manner

1.3.1.1 "Publicly funded" includes any research undertaken whilst employed or studying at RGU, including where studies are self-funded. Specific contractual arrangements relating to research funded by a commercial interest may be put in place on a case by case basis

1.3.2 the principles set out in the Concordat on Open Research Data the UKRI common principles on data policy

1.3.4 the FAIR data principles

RGU advocates an open access approach to research data wherever possible. However, open access needs to be balanced with the constraints of security, confidentiality and commercial interest.



This policy provides detailed information to supplement the RGu Research Governance and Integrity policy. Safe and ethical handling of data is a fundamental part of good practice for research, demonstrating; honesty, rigour, transparency and open communication, care and respect. The RGU Information Governance Policy also provides context, with explicit explanation of the legislative environment governing the handling of any personal data."""^^xsd:string .

3.1 Data Management Plan: A Data Management Plan outlines what data is likely to be created through the course of research and how. The plan also outlines plans for the preservation of the data and how/if it will be shared, stating any restrictions on access that may need to be applied.

3.2 Data Repository: A place for preserving digital data after a project ends, and making it available for others to use. Selecting a trusted repository for your data The RCA research repository (ePrints), a discipline specific repository or a funder repository) is beneficial in that it will relieve the researcher of the long-term management of the data and will ensure its long term accessibility.

3.3 Principal Investigator: A person who is ultimately responsible for a research project. This includes intellectual, managerial and financial responsibility of research.

3.4 Permanent Digital Identifier (PDI): A unique permanent digital identifier used to identify datasets and publications. The PDI is fixed for the lifetime of the data and ensures that data can be cited appropriately to ensure credit is given to its creator/s.

3.5 Metadata: Metadata provides information about the dataset. This information includes descriptive information such as keywords, author, title and also process data which will describe methods through which data is collected and processed. Good standard metadata is vital for enabling the finding and reuse of data.

3.6 Data Licencing: Datasets should have a licence that states clearly what the re-use rights are. This will allow researchers who find a dataset to immediately know what they are allowed to do with it. For example, licenced images or music will state how specifically whether commercial use is allowed, whether the work can be remixed or tweaked, or whether it can be downloaded only. Licencing also applies to research data."""^^xsd:string .

4.1 RDM is part of good research practice and as such adds value to research outputs and increases their impact. This policy will guide RCA researchers to undertake best practice in RDM to ensure excellence in research conduct and to comply with funders‚Äô requirements of data management, openness and sharing.

4.2 This policy‚Äôs guiding principles take inspiration from the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Common principles on data policy2, and the Concordat on Open Research Data3 which guides the UK research community on best practices in RDM, and on making their data openly available for use wherever possible.

Principle 1: Good research data management is fundamental to all stages of the research process and should be established at the outset. Data with long-term value should be preserved and should remain accessible and usable for future research.

Principle 2: Data from research funded by public funds is a public good and should be made accessible and open, whenever possible. Open research data safeguards efficient and effective research practice,  facilitates high quality research, and drives innovation.

Principle 3: To enable research data to be discoverable and effectively re-used by others, researchers should use the FAIR4 principles for guidance and as far as possible make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable.

Principle 4: There may be ethical, legal and commercial aspects to research, which may hinder the sharing of research data. Researchers should ensure that these are considered at all stages in the research process, to avoid publishing and sharing unsuitable data.

Principle 5: Researchers should acknowledge and properly cite the sources of data they use in their research to recognise the intellectual contribution of their fellow researchers, who generate, preserve and share their datasets.

Principle 6: Researchers that publish data should provide adequate and persistent information for the research data to be cited, to support best research practice."""^^xsd:string .

A. Summary of the RDM Policy

This policy on Research Data Management (RDM) takes as a guiding principle that research data is an important asset and its considered management is part of excellence in research conduct. Well managed data will assist researchers analyse and present their findings, and should the data be deemed to be suitable for publication will allow for validation and scrutiny of research results. Research data is increasingly being shared and published openly, and public research funders now request a data management plan (DMP) to be delivered with each project they fund. The plans describe the plans for management of data through the project lifecycle as well as after it ends. Funders ask that data be published openly if possible, but demonstrate an understanding that some data may not be deemed suitable for open publishing due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons.

This policy presents the roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its research staff in this respect. The Lead researcher on each project (PI) is ultimately responsible for data management, which includes ensuring that:

DMPs are created and maintained throughout the lifecycle of a project. If the project is publicly funded, PIs should abide by funder policies in this regard and use their specific DMP template.
Data is stored securely to avoid data loss or unauthorised access to data.
After a project ends, data is curated for long term storage in a data repository such as the RCA research repository (ePrints).
An evaluation of whether data can be published openly, after a project ends, is undertaken. If data is deemed to be suitable for open publishing, that appropriate measures are taken so that data is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-useable by others.

The RCA (including Research and Knowledge Exchange Office, Library and IT) is responsible for providing support to researchers so that they can carry out their responsibilities as listed above. The RCA has dedicated expert staff and the appropriate technical infrastructure to assist researchers with all aspects of RDM.

    ns1:text """Introduction

This policy presents the principles of good research data management (RDM) within the Royal College of Art (RCA), as well as outlining the roles and responsibilities of the RCA and its staff and students in this respect. Research data is an asset and the RCA recognises its benefit and impact for wider society, the research community, the RCA and its individual researchers. Effective management of research data allows for extension of the value of data beyond the life of any research project, through data openness and sharing, and is an important part of good research conduct. Well managed data leads to higher quality research, increased research visibility and enhanced research collaboration opportunities. RDM is important in light of increasingly collaborative nature of research, where researchers need to share data across platforms and thus need effective systems and processes for storing, accessing and sharing data securely across multi-institutional research teams.

Research data is increasingly being shared and published openly, and public research funders now request a data management plan (DMP) to be delivered with each project they fund1. The plans describe the plans for management of data through the project lifecycle as well plans for storage and curation of data after the project ends. Funders ask that data be published openly if possible, but demonstrate an understanding that some data may not be deemed suitable for open publishing due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons.

The concept of research data within art and design may differ somewhat from that of other disciplines. Research at the RCA encompasses a broad range of disciplines, to include Architecture, Design, Robotics and Materials Science. The variety of research data created within the RCA will take many forms and will mirror this variety of disciplines, processes and the different types of output developed through research and innovation.

RCA is a research-intensive specialist art and design university, which is committed to upholding highest standards of academic research with their staff, students and the broader research community. We aim for research excellence, through providing a supportive research environment, to research staff and students. To this end, RCA has produced this Policy and provides services and guidance to support research staff and students in undertaking best practice in RDM. To further support staff in implementing this policy, RCA facilitates appropriate digital infrastructure to ensure that data is securely stored and is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable by others. The RCA understands that not all data can be shared, or made open, due to legal, commercial and ethical reasons, but also that these issues should not stand in the way of good research data management."""^^xsd:string .

The University has policies and procedures in place to ensure good research practice and to sustain programmes of excellent and ethical research. Policies are also concerned with research quality promoting the highest standards of integrity, impartiality and respect for data. The University recognises that effective research data management through the research life cycle is a key component of good research conduct and contributes to a culture of research excellence. Research data is a valuable asset and the University supports the principle of open access to research data as set out by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Research Councils UK (RCUK). Research data refers to any type of data created, collected or generated in a digital or non-digital form that is analysed to produce original research results.

The aims of this policy are to

support openness and transparency in research undertaken at the University by ensuring research
is of the highest integrity and is underpinned by accurate robust data
promote open access to research data to facilitate data sharing and collaboration and support the
University's charitable mission of disseminating research findings
ensure that the University adheres to the Research Councils UK Common Principles on Data
Policy, is compliant with the specific requirements of the EPSRC policy framework on research
data and provides accountability for the use of public funds
establish the responsibilities of researchers in relation to research data management and archiving
and set out the University's processes for support and guidance"""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """Policy requirements

1. Data management

1.1. Responsibility for research data generated during a project lies with the principal investigator or in the case of a PhD project, the director of studies. It is their duty to ensure that all members of the research team with access to the research data adhere to good research data management practice. In the case of collaborative projects, if the principal investigator is based elsewhere, the lead researcher at Sheffield Hallam University must take responsibility for all data generated here.

1.2. A data management plan must be produced for all research projects before they commence. Researchers will comply with funder data management requirements. However, where this is not specified, the University will provide a data management plan template for completion.

1.3. A collaboration agreement must be in place with external partners before the start of the research that clearly addresses data management.

2. Live data

2.1. Researchers must comply with funder data management requirements. Where this is not specified researchers must ensure that all active research data is stored securely on the University networked storage system in both original and processed formats. The University has created a central research data file store (the SHU Research Store) for this purpose and will provide advice on technical solutions for research data storage and archiving. Metadata describing the structure and content of the data must be regularly created and updated for project continuity purposes.

If research data needs to be stored temporarily on portable storage devices, such as laptops in the field or cloud storage, the researcher must ensure that this is done securely and that they comply with the University's policies on electronic data encryption."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """3. Archiving

3.1. Primary research data produced by University researchers that underpin a publication, which are of potential long-term value and/or support a patent application, must be stored centrally and published when possible to ensure good research practice at the University.

3.2. Primary research data, whether in digital or hard copy, may be archived in the SHU Research Data Archive or in an external research data repository. Data must be stored for a period at least as long as that required by any funder or sponsor of the research, any publisher of the research or as set out in the University's Research and Knowledge Transfer Records Retention Schedule.

3.3.It is considered good practice to archive all data in a format that will guarantee long-term access and with sufficient metadata to aid discovery to encourage follow-up research. Researchers must also comply with specific funder data management requirements.

3.4. All data that are retained must be registered with the SHU Research Data Archive, whether they are hosted by the University or maintained elsewhere, even if access to the data is restricted."""^^xsd:string .

pt:Chunk_65_4 a ns1:chunk ;

    ns1:text """4. Open access

4.1. Researchers must be aware of, and comply with, their funders' requirements for data management including archiving and sharing. If applicable, data must be prepared and offered for deposit in an open access data repository within the timeframe stipulated by the funder unless there are valid reasons not to do so. The latter could include commercial confidentiality, infringement of intellectual property rights, contractual agreements, ethical, legal or regulatory obligations, or where the cost of doing so would be prohibitive.

4.2. Even if the funder of the research does not require it, researchers are encouraged to make their archived data accessible to others close to the publication date of any research outputs relying on the data. The data should be in citeable form. This supports the integrity of the University's research and will be beneficial for the research community.

4.3. Exclusive rights to re-use or publish research data should not be handed over to commercial publishers or agents without retaining the rights to make the data openly available for re-use unless this is a condition of funding.

4.4. Published research outputs reporting publicly funded research must include a short statement describing how and on what terms any supporting research data may be accessed. Research outputs deposited in SHURA should also include this statement.

5. Re-using third-party data

5.1. Researchers that gain access to and use open research data, or any data generated by others, must do so in a manner that respects the contexts under which it was created and must

adhere to the same frameworks and observe any restrictions that may have been imposed during data collection.

5.2. All users of research data must formally cite the data they use. The obligation to recognise through citation and acknowledgement the original creators of the data must be respected in all cases.

6. Support and further information

6.1. The University will provide guidelines, advice and training on research data management, including data management plans, costing of research data management into research proposals, storage and data protection, creation of descriptive metadata, intellectual property and Freedom of Information requests for all researchers."""^^xsd:string .

Since its creation, the Sorbonne University Alliance has chosen to be fully involved in the open science movement, allowing access to knowledge for all. With this in mind, it is committed to opening up the results of the research produced within its institutions and promoting their dissemination, in order to share with citizens the fruits of their contribution to public research and to develop a trustworthy science.

Taking up for itself the terms of the Sorbonne declaration on research data rights of 27 January 20201, the Sorbonne University Alliance recalls that :

access to and sharing of data enables the development of new knowledge and accelerates discoveries for the benefit of society, while promoting economic development and employment;
it must be possible to share and re-use research data freely.

The management of research data, including backup, storage and diffusion, must therefore be carried out in accordance with international standards and practices and meet strict requirements, while ensuring compliance with legal obligations within an ethical framework.

For these reasons, the Sorbonne University Alliance and its members are committed to :

encouraging their research teams and staff to open up research data as much as possible;
promoting the development of data management plans at the design stage of research protocols;
enhancing the commitment of research staff who share their data and work for open science;
setting up training programmes and mobilising the necessary resources to create an environment conducive to open data.

One way to make data accessible for reuse is to upload and describe data files in, preferably certified, data catalogues (repositories) where data is accessible via the web35. Data generated at SLU should, as far as possible, be made openly accessible in data catalogues that provide data with a persistent identifier (PID) 36 in order to, among other things, facilitate proper citation of data. So as to comply with the FAIR data sharing principles, SLU offers support in reviewing and improving metadata and data when making it accessible and depositing, both in data catalogues37 and other commonly existing solutions utilised in research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment at SLU.

In data catalogues, the data licence can often be specified in the metadata. By means of licences users become aware of the purposes for which data may be used and the conditions for further sharing. Licensing is an important component of meeting the FAIR data sharing principles. However, principles for licensing data by SLU are not included in this version of the policy due to ongoing national discussions on this issue.

Data must be made available according to the principle "as early as possible, as late as necessary", based on the conditions of the project or study. Within environmental monitoring and assessment, each study must consider when it is appropriate to make data available, since much data collection continues over time without a cut-off date. Even in time-limited projects, especially should such run over a longer period of time, reasons may exist to make subsets of data accessible already during the course of the project.

Embargoes may arise between project completion or publication of research results and the time when data may be made accessible. This may, for example, be due to the data being a trade secret in which case the timing of making data available

Research and environmental monitoring and assessment data generated at SLU are considered official documents and are subject to the constitutional principle of public access to official records38. Thus, data must be, as a rule, released upon request and preserved in SLU's archives. Copyright applies to the results of research recorded in a work (e.g., a scientific publication). Primary data must be archived and preserved in order to make such research results verifiable. Laws and regulations govern whether confidentiality can be invoked or whether documents can be disposed of after a certain time.39 Archiving of research and environmental monitoring and assessment data requires that the data is well documented, reliable, and readable. The archiving requirements are in many ways consistent with what is needed for information security and making data accessible, yet preserving documents is not the same as storing or making data accessible. Prior to and during projects and studies that generate data, those responsible must decide what applies to, for example, confidentiality and disposal deadlines, preferably in a data management plan. Data must be archived at the latest at the end of a project or study.

Open knowledge sharing and open science are emphasised in SLU's strategy for 2021-20255, at the national level in the Research Policy Bill for 2021-20246, and at European level in the EU Open Data Directive7. The goal at national level is to make all publicly funded research data openly accessible by 2026, provided there are no legal, security, ethical, or commercial issues. The aim is to increase the quality, dissemination, impact, and innovative power of research. Another reason for making data accessible is to make efficient use of resources. This concerns both financial resources and, for example, a reduction in the use of animal and human experiments. An important starting point for this policy is the national Roadmap for Open Science devised by the Association of Swedish Higher Education8, which clarifies the responsibilities of higher education institutions and the measures required to accelerate the work on open access to research data and results.

[Read more about background to and rationale for the policy]

The policy supports SLU staff in the transition to open science by expressing common principles and assigning responsibilities regarding the management and accessibility of research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment data throughout its entire lifecycle9. It serves as a guide in the development of einfrastructures and support functions and it also aims to ensure that the University complies with relevant legislation and commitments to external stakeholders when it comes to data management. SLU, moreover, has a policy for scientific publishing10 in place, which represents an additional important component in the work to promote open science.

The policy applies only to digital material, both raw and aggregated data, that is produced, processed and used in projects and studies at SLU and that underlies the results, conclusions, and bases for decision-making generated by research as well as environmental monitoring and assessment.

If ownership is agreed upon, it does not mean that a party owns the data but rather that the party has rights and obligations towards the other parties within the project/study that usually come with ownership (such as the right to use the data in further research or commercially, the right to publish, and archive them, etc.). Confidentiality can also be agreed upon but then binds no one other than the contracting parties. The principle of public access to official documents cannot be waived, and should there be no basis for confidentiality according to the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act23 then the data must be disclosed upon request. To the extent that a funder imposes requirements on how data within a project or study should be stored and made openly available, the funder's requirements shall be followed, provided that Swedish legislation is complied with. Should data belong to another organisation, such as a private company or a public authority in another country, access may be restricted or blocked.

Translation of the official German text ‚ÄûLeitlinien zum Umgang mit digitalen Forschungsdaten an der TU Darmstadt‚Äú

from December 12th 2015, revised on September 8th 2022

## Preamble

The Technical University of Darmstadt (TUDa) considers the responsible and scientifically appropriate handling of research data to be an essential contribution to the acquisition and dissemination of scientific knowledge as an implementation of its principles for ensuring good scientific practice. In line with the institutional goals of sustainability and digitization, it promotes and supports the preservation and documentation of research data as well as structured and free access to them in accordance with the FAIR principles with the aim of increasing the findability, accessibility, interoperability and reusability of research data. The guidelines for handling digital research data apply to all research projects at TU Darmstadt, including student work.

Traceability and scientific verifiability of research as well as the best possible scientific use of the data obtained are equally important goals. When implementing research data management, the guidelines take into account the specific characteristics of the various disciplines. The implementation of the guidelines should not restrict the commercial exploitation of research results.

The implementation of the guidelines is accompanied by the central working group TUdata, which provides technical, organizational and legal advice on all areas of research data management and supports the members of TUDa with a broad service portfolio and recommendations for action. To this end, TUDa cooperates with other scientific institutions, participates in the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) and uses common standards and structures.

These guidelines were adopted by the Executive Board of the Technical University of Darmstadt on September 8th 2022 and become effective immediately.

These guidelines are regularly reviewed by the central institutions and committees involved to ensure that they are up to date and can be adapted to new requirements, infrastructural developments and the needs of researchers.

In compliance with intellectual property rights, and unless third-party rights, legal requirements, Rectorate decisions, other reasonable interests or property laws prohibit it, research data should be assigned an open use license.7

Citation norms and requirements regarding publication and future research should be followed; data sources should be explicitly traceable in order for the original sources to be acknowledged.

Research data and records are to be stored and made available in accordance with intellectual property laws or the requirements of third-party funders as well as applicable legal or contractual requirements (e.g. EU restrictions on where identifiable personal data may be stored). Research data that may be of future historical interest and the records accompanying them should also be archived.

The minimum retention period for research data and records is 10 years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of a related work following research completion, whichever is later.

In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required retention period or for legal or ethical reasons, such action is to be carried out only after consideration of all legal and ethical perspectives.

The goal of TU Berlin is to further develop science and technology for the benefit of our society. The members of the university are wholly committed to the principle of sustainable development. TU Berlin carries out basic and application-oriented research at top international level and promotes cross-faculty research activities and networks with external actors as well as knowledge and technology transfer between the university and practical applications. To this goal, TU Berlin forms strategic alliances with companies as well as university and non-university research facilities.

Research data is a valuable resource and a basis for scientific knowledge and has a long-term value for research and science, with the potential for widespread use in society. Research data is all information (regardless of form or representation) that arise during a research process or is its result, including the information necessary to verify and reproduce the results. Research data includes measurement data, lab values, audiovisual information, texts, objects from collections or samples, surveys, and interviews, but also notes, time histories/recordings, calculations, software and code. TU Berlin is aware of the fundamental significance of research data for maintaining the quality of research and scientific integrity and is committed to follow recognized standards that meet the highest requirements. TU Berlin acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data is the foundation and integral part of every research activity as it is necessary for the verification and reproducibility of research processes and results.

With this policy, TU Berlin wants to provide its current and future researchers with an orientation for handling research data. The policy refers in particular to the recommendations of the German Council of Science and the Humanities (2012)1 and the German Rectors‚Äô Conference (2014)2 as well as to the ‚ÄúGuidelines on the Handling of Research Data‚Äù (2015)3 of the German Research Foundation.

Maintaining the integrity of research data is essential: Research data must be stored in a correct, complete, unadulterated, and reliable manner. Furthermore, according to the FAIR principles, research data must also be identifiable, accessible, verifiable, interoperable, and, whenever possible, available for subsequent use.

In accordance with its Open Access Policy, TU Berlin supports open access to research data. In compliance with intellectual property rights and if no third-party rights, data protection rights, and legal or contractual provisions prohibit it, TU Berlin recommends that research data should be assigned a license for open use, such as Creative Commons, to enable the reuse of the research data.

Research data shall be stored in a suitable repository or archive system, shall be assigned a persistent identifier and metadata, and if possible, made openly accessible. The applicable research ethics and data privacy regulations are to be considered.

The minimum storage period for research data is ten years after either the assignment of a persistent identifier or the publication of the related work following research project completion, whichever is later.

Adherence to citation rules and requirements regarding publication and future use of the research data must be ensured. When research data is reused, the origin of the data must clearly be verifiable and the original sources must be named.

If research data is to be deleted or destroyed after the expiration period of the storage, this will be carried out only after considering all legal and ethical aspects. When making a decision about the retention and destruction of data, the interests and contractual stipulations of third-party funders and other stakeholders, employees, and partners, as well as the aspects regarding confidentiality and safety must be taken into consideration.

1) The researching members of Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig are responsible for deciding which data is worth being archived and published as well as for documenting, providing and long-term archiving of the research data. By saving and archiving the data in a recognised repository, researchers fulfil their requirement to adhere to good scientific practice (archiving for at least
10 years).
2) When managing research data, researchers ensure they adhere to ethical, data security, copyright or confidentiality principles.
3) We recommend making research data and research software publicly available with an academic publication according to Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig's open access guidelines.3 For this, it is recommended that researchers choose an open licence (e.g. Creative Commons) to make it easier for fellow researchers to use the data. This is done under consideration of requirements set by the research project's funding organisations and partners. FAIR Data Principles4 as well as software and data citation principles5 must be upheld.

Guidelines for Handling Research Data at Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig

4) For saving the results of research projects, Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig recommends planning research data management in the initial project planning phases, or when writing a grant application and creating a research data management plan at an early point in time. A data management plan documents how data is to be gathered, processed and saved from obtaining data to publication.

Technische Universit√§t Braunschweig commits to creating requirements necessary to fulfil these principles and, with its central infrastructure institutions ‚Äî a cooperation among the Research Service and European Office, Gau√ü-IT-Zentrum and the University Library, to support researchers with appropriate measures for infrastructure, advising and continuing education."""^^xsd:string .

## Guidelines on the handling of research data at TU Dresden

These Guidelines have been adopted by the Senate of Technische Universit√§t Dresden in its meeting on 13th June 2018.

### Preamble

The transparency of research is a key component of good scientific practice. It includes the responsible handling of research data as both the basis for one's own scientific research and the basis for further research - irrespective of the original purpose of data collection.

In its 'Guidelines for Safeguarding Good Scientific Practice, Avoiding Scientific Misconduct and Dealing with Violations' (version of 5th March 2014), TU Dresden has stipulated guidelines for the handling of primary data in ¬ß 5. For the implementation of these guidelines and the handling of research data in general (i.e. beyond primary data), TU Dresden has adopted the following specific guidelines for the handling of research data.

#### What is research data?

Research data refers to all data collected, observed, derived, simulated or otherwise generated in connection with research. Research data is present in any scientific discipline in different forms and formats.

The principles of open science and engagement are central to Teesside University‚Äôs Research Strategy (2020-2025) and the University‚Äôs mission to generate and apply knowledge that contributes to the economic, social and cultural success of students, partners and the communities we serve.

1.2 The University recognises the importance of good data management in assuring the integrity of its research and in supporting approaches to open science. It supports the principles of the Concordat on Open Research Data1 which state that ‚Äòresearch data should, wherever possible be made openly available for use by others in a manner consistent with relevant legal, ethical, disciplinary and regulatory frameworks and norms‚Äô.

1.3 To embed good practice in research and ensure research data are easily accessible, the University has developed this Research Data Management Policy in accordance with The Concordat on Open Research Data, Funder requirements, and best practice for research data management as set out in the LEARN2 Toolkit.

1.4 The University‚Äôs position on related issues is set out in its policies for Open Access, Data Protection, Research Ethics, Freedom of Information and Information Security."""^^xsd:string .

Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.

3.2 Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators may also be expected to comply with the policy.

3.3 Research data refers to all information (independent of form or presentation) needed to support or validate the development, results, observations or findings of a research project, including contextual information. Research data include all materials which are created in the course of academic work, including digitisation, records, source research, experiments, measurements, surveys and interviews. This includes software and code. Research data can take on several forms during the lifespan of a research project. Data can exist as gradations of raw data, processed data (including negative and inconclusive results), published data and Open Access published data, and with varying levels of access, including open data, restricted data and closed data."""^^xsd:string .

5.2 It is important to preserve the integrity of research data and they must be stored in a correct reliable manner. Data storage should follow FAIR data principles5 and must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, interoperable, and whenever possible, available for subsequent use.

5.3 Non-digital research data should be stored in a form that would allow for sharing and access if required. The fact that research data is non-digital does not provide a sufficient reason for restricting access.

Research data is defined as the evidence base on which academic researchers build their analytic or other work. Such data may be in any form, but may include ‚Äúdigital information created directly from research activities such as experiments, analysis, surveys, measurements, instrumentation and observations; data resulting from automated or manual data reduction and analysis including the inputs and outputs of simulations and models‚Äù2.

This policy defines the standards that govern the management of research data at the Open University.

Research data management (RDM) is a recognised part of the research process and scholarly communications.

repositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data, and consider whether it will be made openly available (perhaps as open source software), and if so what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is another consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time.

The University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment),11 ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID),12 digital object identifiers (DOIs),13 and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code."""^^xsd:string .

The current policy has been recognised nationally and internationally as an excellent example, being one of the first of its kind to be written and passed and has been a basis for many other UK universities to build upon. However, the passage of ten years means that important concepts such as FAIR1 and GDPR are missing; also review period and further context has been added.

The University‚Äôs Research Data Service offers tools and support for managing data before, during and after data are generated by research projects (  The service is part of the broader Digital Research Services which acts as a single point of access to all of the data and computing services available to researchers at the University of Edinburgh, including the Edinburgh International Data Facility.

Responsibility for managing data during any research project or programme lies with Principal Investigators (PIs) or individual researchers (academic staff or postgraduate research students) working on their own. When responsibility is delegated to data managers, the PI retains accountability, and is responsible as data owner (and data controller when personal data are collected) on behalf of the University. The PI should choose methods, platforms and services for managing data that are affordable through the research grant and comply with University policy and procedures, as well as their funder‚Äôs requirements and those of any external data controller. Researchers should be familiar with University RDM solutions as well as disciplinary tools and infrastructure available to them, including their full costs, terms and conditions, in order to make optimal choices for active and archived research data. This approach is commensurate with the University‚Äôs commitment to academic freedom.

Researchers must create a data management plan (DMP) at the time of their research proposal if any research data are to be collected or used. Plans should cover data types and volume, capture, storage, integrity, confidentiality, retention and destruction, sharing and deposit. A suggested minimum period of retention is three years from the end of the project, however requirements by funders and data providers, as well as disciplinary guidance should be observed.

Research data management plans must specify how and when research data will be made available for access and reuse. Generally, accompanying research data should be made available as soon as findings are published, under appropriate safeguards when necessary. A Data Protection Impact Assessment is required whenever data pertaining to individuals is used.6 Research outputs which convey findings from research data should include a citation or data access statement which clearly provides a route for readers to obtain the data. When the researcher does not hold the intellectual property rights or have permission to make derived data available they must provide a citation or data access statement in relevant publications to the source of data.

Costs such as extra storage, long-term retention, or data management effort must be addressed and included in the total cost to funders whose policies accept RDM costs.

The University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible with as few restrictions as necessary.8 Additionally, many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).9 FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns, suggesting the need for information governance processes over usage when necessary.10 Principal Investigators and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans.

Discoverability and access by machines is considered as important as access by humans, in order to accelerate global science and progress Open Research. FAIR calls for the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research data in repositories. Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available.

The University also supports ‚Äúeasy access‚Äù IP and other emerging areas that are part of the ‚Äúopen‚Äù landscape.

The University of Exeter is committed to complying with funders‚Äô policies and recognises that the academic community requires support in interpreting and observing sometimes conflicting policies.

The University‚Äôs Open Access Research and Research Data Management Policy supports the HEFCE and RCUK position that publicly funded research is a public good that should be made openly available to the public when legally, commercially and ethically appropriate. This policy is designed to help support researchers comply with funding bodies‚Äô requirements on Open Access to research papers and on research data management. This is paramount as the University risks loss of income if it fails to satisfy funders‚Äô expectations in this area.

The University recognises that good practice in research data management is a key part of research excellence. Research data are the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question, and can be used to validate findings regardless of its form (e.g. print, digital, or physical)1. These might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. They may include, for example, experimental measurements, predictions from models, statistics, collections

of digital images, sound recordings, transcripts of interviews, survey data and fieldwork observations with appropriate annotations, an interpretation, an artwork, archives, found objects, published texts or a manuscript.

Research data are a valuable asset. It is the collaborative responsibility of researchers and the institution that they are appropriately managed and stored both during and after the research process: to meet legislative, funder, information governance and University requirements; to facilitate data security (confidentiality, integrity, availability); to facilitate appropriate access, collaboration and sharing of data and results.  Good research data management brings benefits to the researcher, the University and the wider community. Examples of such benefits include ensuring that research data is stored safely thus avoiding data loss, the possibility of validating research findings and the ability to reuse and share data sets.

The University of Manchester recognizes the fundamental importance of research data and the management of related administrative records in maintaining quality research and research integrity and is committed to pursuing the highest standards. The University acknowledges that correct and easily retrievable research data are the foundation of and integral to every research study. They are necessary for the verification and defence of research processes and results. Research data have a long-term value for research and academia, with the potential for widespread use in society.

The University endorses the Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy and requires all its researchers to adhere to them, as well as taking into account any other research data management requirements that may apply.

The purpose of this Policy is to provide guidance and support on the responsibilities of the University and its researchers in managing and preserving current or future research data."""^^xsd:string .

    ns1:text """Scope and definitions

This Policy applies to:

all research, regardless of whether or not the research is externally funded, and is subject to the provisions of any relevant contracts including funding/collaboration agreements; and all researchers active at The University of Manchester.

Research is any creative and systematically performed work with the goal of furthering knowledge, including discoveries regarding people, culture and society, in addition to the use of such knowledge for new applications.

Researchers refers to all research-active members of an institution including employees and doctoral candidates. Persons not directly affiliated with an institution, but who, for purposes of research, make use of or are physically present at the institution, are also included in the term. Visiting researchers or collaborators will also be expected to comply with the Policy.

Research data is the evidence that underpins the answer to the research question and can be used to validate findings. This might be quantitative information or qualitative statements collected by researchers in the course of their work by experimentation, observation, modelling, interview or other methods, or information derived from existing evidence. Research data may take the form of numbers, symbols, text, images or sounds, including computer code, annotated fieldwork observations, or a descriptive record of a physical sample.

Information store is where information is held/stored, for example, paper records in a filing cabinet, data held in IT systems, records stored onsite and offsite (e.g. in the Cloud), approved encrypted removable media. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.

Information Store Owners are accountable for information held within the information store including the approval of any processing activities. For example, the Head of Research Governance, Ethics and Integrity is accountable for information processed in the Data Safe Haven. Where the

information in an information store is created through many processing activities and accessed by many users (such as the University‚Äôs research studies) the Information Store Owner may delegate responsibility for the processing activities to a Processing Activity Owner.  Information Store Owners also include, for example, the creators of databases, spreadsheets, computer code or physical sample collections (this list is not intended to be exhaustive) where they may also be the Processing Activity Owner. The Information Governance Accountability and Assurance Framework Standard Operating Procedure describes the wider accountabilities of Information Store Owners."""^^xsd:string .

Furthermore, they must be identifiable, accessible, traceable, re-usable, and whenever possible, interoperable and made available in a timely way with as few restrictions as possible.

Research data is to be stored, made available and assigned a licence for open use in compliance with legal, ethical, and contractual requirements, and providing no funder, third-party or contractual rights prohibit it. Research data of future historical interest and the administrative records accompanying research projects should also be archived.

Research data is a legitimate product of research and must be cited as such adhering to scholarly norms; re-used data must be explicitly traceable and original sources acknowledged.

The minimum archive duration for research data and records are subject to the University‚Äôs Records Management Policy and Records Retention Schedule.

In the event that research data and records are to be deleted or destroyed, either after expiration of the required archive duration or for legal or ethical reasons, such action will be carried out only after considering all legal and ethical perspectives.

The University supports the broad global consensus that publicly funded research data should be made openly available as soon as possible and with as few restrictions as necessary.  Many UK and international funders have embraced FAIR principles for data sharing (making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable).  FAIR acknowledges legitimate reasons for restricting access to data, such as confidentiality concerns.  Principal Investigators/Researchers and research students should consider how they can best make their data FAIR in their Data Management Plans.

Discoverability and access by machines are considered as important as access by humans. FAIR encourages the use of persistent identifiers, standard metadata, vocabularies, and licences to allow researchers and computer programs to directly access and process data. An emphasis on reusability means that any relevant documentation, protocols, or designs which add context and usefulness to the data should be included with research datasets in repositories (Pure).  Links to relevant publications, people, projects, and other research products such as software or source code should be provided in metadata records, with persistent identifiers when available.

In some cases, research products such as models and software code can be deposited with research data in data/subject repositories. However, it may be more appropriate to utilise software repositories such as GitLab or GitHub, which offer the ability for partners or others to develop code into new directions while keeping track of versions. Research projects should plan for their software management as well as their data and consider whether it will be made openly available and if so, what licence is appropriate. In all cases code should be documented in a way that makes its functions transparent to improve quality and enable reuse of software and data. For long-lived projects software sustainability is a further consideration which requires updating and refactoring over time.

The University endorses the FAIR data sharing principles for maximising data reuse, and supports related initiatives such as DORA (Declaration on Research Assessment), ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID), digital object identifiers (DOIs), and use of standard open licences for sharing research data and code."""^^xsd:string .

Research data are of great value to Tilburg University and should be managed in a responsible manner. Responsible research data management is essential, from the principles of ‚Äòscrupulousness and transparency‚Äô as stated in ‚ÄòThe Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity‚Äô. Furthermore, it is in line with the conditions of national and European research funders to stimulate open science and reuse of research data.

‚ÄòThe Netherlands Code of Conduct for Research Integrity‚Äô denominates the institutions‚Äô duties of care to promote and maintain compliance with the code. The Tilburg University Strategy emphasizes the importance of research integrity, and encourages researchers to make their data and research materials publicly available if possible.

Although managing research data may vary considerably across research disciplines, the Executive Board chooses to offer one university-wide Research Data Management Regulation, in which the joint principles for responsible management of research data are stated. The aim of research data management is to guarantee accessibility to research data and protection of research data against theft, misuse, damage, and loss. The researcher should take care to adequately store and archive his/her research data, and make them retrievable and accessible. Responsible data storage leads to transparency (e.g. allowing other researchers to check published results) and offers possibilities for knowledge dissemination, meta-analysis, and reanalysis. Schools will specify the Research Data Management Regulation in an operating procedure for their School, tailored to the specific circumstances of the research discipline in question and internal School processes."""^^xsd:string .

This guideline elaborates on a number of practical points from the Research Data Management Regulation. The guideline serves, on the one hand, as an aid for Schools in the development of School policy and, on the other hand, as an explanation of Article 8 (Personal Data) and Article 9 (Third Parties) of the Research Data Management Regulation.

The guideline offers:

1. an overview of items that may be part of a School data management policy (the checklists in Chapters 1 through 4);
2. instructions for dealing with the obligations of the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 which entered into force on May 1, 2018 if research is carried out with personal data (Chapters 5 and 6);
3. Explanation of the support services for research data management via the Research Data Office (RDO) (Chapter 7).

A data management plan (DMP) is a digital document in which the researcher describes what data he or she will collect during a research project, how he or she will store and manage the data during the project, and what will happen to the data after the project has ended. The DMP is drawn up at the start of a new research project. Various models (templates) and checklists are available for drawing up a data management plan, often provided by the research institute or funding agency. The completed template forms the data management plan. During the course of the project, regular checks are carried out to ensure that the plan is still up to date or needs to be adjusted.

The Research Data Management Regulation requires that a data management plan is written at the start of each new research project or program. In the School‚Äôs data management policy the following matters can be agreed:

Who draws up the data management plan for a project?
For which type of research should a data management plan be drawn up? (for example, projects of PhD candidates and research funded by the NWO or other research funds); How is the drafting of data management plans supervised? To whom should a data management plan be submitted? For information or consent?
How is the updating of data management plans monitored?
Are data management plans stored centrally? If so, where? and who has access to it? Which matters that appear in a data management plan can be arranged at the level of the School or institute?

How do you organize the safe collection of research data?
Where are data stored for ongoing research?

and assigning a persistent identifier to the data (a unique code used to refer/link to the dataset) (see also the section on archiving). Tilburg University offers its researchers the institutional data repository DataverseNL. Tilburg University Dataverse has obtained the CoreTrustSeal quality mark.

Datasets containing sensitive data‚Äïintellectual property rights of third parties, personal data, corporate information, information that can cause damage when made public‚Äïcannot be made freely available. However, these data may be useful for new research. For many data archives it is possible to publish a description of this data and to make the data available only on request.

If an external party outside the regular scientific process submits a request for access to research data, the researcher can contact the Research Data Office for legal advice. This is to prevent that datasets are provided in violation of the rights of third parties. Conditions may be attached to the consent.

Before the researcher decides to file his/her dataset publicly, he/she will also consider whether the dataset may have commercial value. If so, the researcher may decide to file the dataset with restricted/monitored access.

The following points can be included in the School‚Äôs operating procedure/policy:

It is also important that research data are handled carefully in accordance with the Research Data Management Regulation when collaborating with or conducting research on behalf of a third party. However, third parties are not necessarily bound by the Research Data Management Regulations. Third parties may be bound by internal regulations of their own institution or organization. It is, therefore, important that the subject of data management is part of the agreements made prior to the research and that these agreements are added to the collaboration agreement or commission agreement.

Students are also considered as third parties in this respect. If a student participates in a research under the responsibility of a Tilburg University researcher, the researcher will have to ensure that the student signs a statement in which he/she declares that he/she is familiar with the Research Data Management Regulations and will act in accordance with them. A standard model for such a statement is available.

In the event that the research data contain personal data, it may be necessary to conclude a socalled processor agreement. In many cases, the use of software and/or tools for the storage and/or collection of research data must also be based on a processor agreement with the owner of the software and/or tools. This also applies if a third party collects and/or stores the data on behalf of the researcher.

    ns1:text """1. Policy Background

Researchers and students at UCL create data as part of the research workflow.  These data represent the evidence that underpins academic endeavours and form one half of the scholarly record, the other half represented by publication output.

Data are facts, observations or experiences on which an argument or theory is constructed or tested.  Data may be numerical, descriptive, aural or visual.  Data may be raw, abstracted or analysed, experimental or observational.  Data include but are not limited to: laboratory notebooks; field notebooks; primary research data (including research data in hardcopy or in computer readable form); questionnaires; audiotapes; videotapes; models; photographs; films; test responses.  Research collections may include slides; artefacts; specimens; samples.

Advances in technology have enabled the exponential growth in the creation of data, which in turn has led to both novel abilities in conducting research (data-driven science) and a new, significant data management burden.

UCL recognises that appropriate management of research data leads to an enhanced research practice respecting specialist knowledge, supporting synthesis of new knowledge and facilitating collective and collaborative working practices in order to gain wisdom1.  UCL considers the research data generated by its members as a valuable research output, an asset to the institution and a critical contribution to the knowledge economy2

The purpose of this Policy is to provide a framework to define the responsibilities of all UCL members and to guide researchers and students in how to manage the data, enabling research data to be maintained and preserved as a first class research object and made available to widest possible audience for the highest possible impact.

This policy is intended to ensure that research data created as part of the research process are:

Accurate, complete, authentic and reliable;
Attributable and citable;
Identifiable, retrievable and available with minimal barriers;
Secure from loss and degradation;
Retained for a minimum of ten years after publication or public release;
Compliant with legal obligations, ethical responsibilities and the rules of funding bodies."""^^xsd:string .

1. It is the policy of UCL that its members can fulfil the requirements of good research practice by enabling them to manage research data in a manner that maximises data impact and acknowledges data value as primary research output by its members.
2. It is the policy of UCL that responsibility for managing and preserving research data is shared between all members of the College.
3. It is the policy of UCL that following primary use (e.g. publication) or when research data is archived for long term preservation, these data will be made available in the most open manner appropriate. Unless covered by third party contractual agreements, legislative obligations3 or provisions regarding ownership, UCL research data will be provided using a Creative Commons CC0 waiver ; supported by data citation guidelines

similar to existing publishing conventions.  This will ensure that re-used data are unambiguously identifiable and that appropriate credit and attribution is made.

4. It is the policy of UCL that clear lines of responsibility are established so that research data generated at UCL will always have an owner, responsible for preserving research data.

In complying with this policy, UCL researchers will comply with all national and many international policies and requirements from funders of academic research5."""^^xsd:string .

Embedding research data management practice in early career researchers is critical to establishing an effective data management ethos.  Good research practice requires students and their supervisor to plan the collection, storage, security and use of research data, in accordance with conventions in their fields of study and obligations from their institutions.

It is the responsibility of students and their supervisors that good practice in data management is planned and documented as part of their research process.  The plan and execution should form a critical part of the research process

Student Researchers and Supervisors should:

Establish collection and storage procedures for their research data that are acceptable to their supervisor.

Heads of Departments often assume ownership of data when researchers leave UCL or have researcher data ownership transferred to them.

It is the responsibility of Heads of Departments to ensure good practice and legal obligations relating to the management of research data within their department are fully supported.  They should identify and implement any training or skills development required in executing their responsibility

Heads of Department should:

Authorise procedures adopted by researchers and student researchers (following consultation with their supervisor) for the collection, storage, use and if required destruction of their research data;
Ensure staff conducting human research, and students under their supervision, are aware of and appropriately trained in all of their responsibilities and obligations relating to research data collected in the course of their research;

Scholarly publication is changing and scientific research articles are being made openly accessible through Open Access. The Swedish Government, funding bodies and large publishers recommend or request that research data is made accessible as far as legislation allows. Research data becomes a natural part of the scholarly publication process.

The objective of the Government‚Äôs research bills ‚ÄúCollaborating for knowledge ‚Äì for society‚Äôs challenges and strengthened competitiveness‚Äù (2016/17:50) and ‚ÄúResearch, freedom, future ‚Äì knowledge and innovation for Sweden‚Äù (2020/21:60), is that a transition to open access to research results, including research data, should be fully implemented by 2026. Ume√• University sees the adoption of this policy as a part of a process to transition to open access to research results.

Through this policy, Ume√• University accepts the recommendation of the Swedish Research Council stating that research data should be managed in accordance with the international FAIR principles for scientific data management1,2.

Ume√• University shares the view that everyone should have open access to research publications and research data that are completely or partly funded by public funds to the extent that is permitted by legislation, ethics and commercial interests. The research data that forms basis for scientific publications must be easily accessible for peer review, journals and publishers and be made accessible in accordance with the recommendations of the Swedish Research Council. All source data and materials that document the research process are property of Ume√• University and must, as a general rule, be archived according to the university‚Äôs records management plan for research, when a research project has been completed.

Ume√• University supports the establishment of sustainable research infrastructures and services for managing research data at a local and national level. Based on current laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Freedom of the Press Act and other regulations, internal regulatory documents and requirements from the Swedish Research Council, the EU and other research funding bodies, Ume√• University offers their researchers support in managing and making research results and research data accessible.

The local infrastructure for research data and research data management is to be developed continuously and must follow laws, regulations and guidelines from the Government, the EU, the Swedish Research Council and other relevant research funding bodies and actors. In this way, correct management, storage, sharing and long-term preservation of research data is ensured.

This policy applies to all employees who conduct research and includes all subjects and areas where research is performed at Ume√• University.

    ns1:text """Introduction

At its Academic Council meeting of 26 April 2021, ULB adopted the following policy1 on the management of Research Data, generated and processed by Researchers as part of their research activities at ULB.

This policy aims to develop and promote a solid and secure management of Research Data to increase the efficiency, the quality, the integrity and the transparency of scientific research, as well as to facilitate the development of new knowledge, and to ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations, ethical and contractual obligations, and provisions of external research funding agencies. Ideally, Research Data management should be considered and integrated throughout the life cycle of the research data.



Furthermore, various research funders such as the FNRS or the European Commission are increasingly requesting that a Data Management Plan accompanies any funded project. This is thus an evolution that urgently needed to be acknowledged in our institution.

This document represents an aspirational policy; its implementation will likely take several years and require communication and support efforts towards the scientific community

Practical Guidelines are available on the ULB personnel portal:"""^^xsd:string .

Data retention primarily concerns all Research Data and accompanying documentation which are reasonably required or appropriate to verify (and reproduce) the scientific claims communicated by the Researcher.

5.2. Research Data and accompanying documentation which were selected for retention should be deposited in a reliable Archive or Data Repository in accordance with the institutional Guidelines to ensure secure, long-term retention and accessibility (with appropriate access rights).

At minimum, if Research Data is deposited in an external Archive, Researchers should supply the metadata for these Research Data in DI-fusion, the ULB institutional repository, with a link to the data in the external Archive. (See institutional Guidelines for depositing and providing access to research data available on the ULB website.)

University College Dublin recognises that the management of research data is fundamental to both high quality research and academic integrity. Accurate and retrievable research data is an essential component of any research project and is necessary to verify and defend the process and outcomes of research.

Research data is valuable to researchers for the duration of their research, and may well have longterm value for research, teaching and for wider exploitation for the public good by individuals, government, business and other organisations.

The objective of the Research Data Management (RDM) Policy is to provide a framework for the management of research data to ensure that research data is stored, retained, made available for use and reuse, and disposed of according to best international practices for data management, as well as in compliance with legal, statutory, ethical, contractual and intellectual property obligations, and the requirements of funding bodies and publishers."""^^xsd:string .

Researchers are responsible for:

Managing research data in accordance with the principles above;
Developing and documenting clear procedures for the collection, storage, use, re-use, access and retention or destruction of the research data and records associated with their research. This shall include, where appropriate, defining protocols and responsibilities in a joint or multiinstitution collaborative research project. This information should be incorporated, where appropriate, in a research data management plan. For research that includes personal data, the researcher needs to identify what contracts or agreements with collaborators or contractors are required to satisfy data protection obligations;
Planning for the ongoing custodianship (at the University or using third-party services) of their data after the completion of the research or, in the event of their departure or retirement from the University, reaching agreement with the Head of School/Institute Director (or their nominee) as to where such data will be located and how this will be stored. Where personal data is part of the research data, it has to be assured that any agreement made is in line with the communication provided to and reasonable expectations of research participants;
Ensuring that any requirements in relation to research data management placed on their research by publishers, funding bodies or regulatory agencies or under the terms of a research contract with the University are also met.

The University provides resources to facilitate Researchers in meeting their responsibilities, in the form of supporting services and expert advice as well as technical infrastructures. Information on available supports is available at the online UCD Research Portal. The University is committed to, and will maintain oversight of, good practice in research data management. To this end, it reserves the right to verify that all research data has been kept in a manner that is compliant with this policy and, where applicable, the requirements of funding bodies and publishers."""^^xsd:string .

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force on 25 May 2018.  It is intended to strengthen data protection for individuals across the EU, and imposes increased obligations on organisations that process personal data.  Processing is very broadly defined as the collection, storage, recording, disclosure of, structuring, making available and erasure or destruction.  The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by controllers and processors in the EU, regardless of whether or not the processing takes place in the EU, and furthermore it restricts the transfer of personal data to locations outside the EU unless certain conditions or safeguards are in place. At the core of the GDPR are seven principles which must be observed by all data controllers and processors. These are transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality and accountability.

The definition of personal data is broad under the GDPR and encompasses ‚Äúany information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person‚Äù.  The GDPR specifically includes ‚Äúlocation data‚Äù, ‚Äúonline identifiers‚Äù such as IP addresses and ‚Äúgenetic‚Äù data as examples of personal data. Certain categories of personal data attract a greater level of protection under the GDPR. These include: personal data relating to racial/ethnic origin, political opinions, religious/philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, health and biometric data, and data concerning sex life or sexual orientation.  However, the GDPR does not apply to fully anonymised or aggregated data where a living individual cannot under any circumstances ever be identified or singled out.

If your research data includes personal data as defined under the GDPR it is very important that the following are consulted: Article 9 of GDPR, UCD GDPR website and the Health Research Board‚Äôs GDPR guidance for researchers."""^^xsd:string .

Researchers are defined as members of the UCD Community carrying out research.

Research data is information collected to be examined and considered, and to serve as a basis for reasoning, discussion or calculation. It is used as a primary source to support technical or scientific enquiry, research, scholarship, or artistic activity, is used as evidence in the research process, and/or is commonly accepted in the research community as necessary to validate research findings and results. Examples of research data are experimental data, observational data, operational data, third party data, public sector data, monitoring data, or repurposed data.  The focus in this policy is on research data that is available in either electronic or paper form.

Research data lifecycle is the sequence of stages that a particular unit of data goes through from its initial generation or capture to its eventual archival and/or deletion at the end of its planned life.

A secure environment is a system or facility which implements the controlled storage and use of research data.

A data management plan or DMP is a formal document that outlines how data is to be handled both during a research project and after the project is completed. Data management plans must assure that research data is traceable, available, authentic, citable, properly stored and that it adheres to clearly defined legal parameters and appropriate safety measures governing subsequent use."""^^xsd:string .

However, if the withdrawal of consent occurs at the time when it affects the possibility of the finalization of the research (for instance, shortly before publication or thesis defense), the withdrawal should result only in the deletion of all personally identifiable data of the participant both in published materials and in stored and processed research data.

Laws of the country where the research takes place should be applied in determining whether participants in the research are children.

Children‚Äôs capacity to consent to research depends on their understanding of the research to be undertaken. Where information about the research and study can be given clearly and simply, it is possible for quite young children to consent to take part in research.  

5.4.4 For a child to give valid consent they would need to understand the nature of the engagement with the researcher and understand that it is different to other interactions with those who may seek information from the child.

Wherever possible such research should be avoided and the Ethical Research Committee will pay particular attention to research involving deception.

An important ambition of UMC Utrecht is 'Open Science ' for better health care and social involvement.  This is about 'open access' (free access to scientific publications), 'open data' and reuse of scientific data, making science more efficient, more widely applicable and reproducible. Data is the foundation of scientific research. Throughout the research cycle, the quality and durability of data must therefore be ensured through careful management. If the quality and durability of data is not in order, the research is not reproducible. Making the data ‚Äòopen‚Äô and reusable is not considered.  Research Data Management (RDM) deals with the collection, documentation, processing, storage, sustainable archiving and reusability of the research data. Funders and publishers also take part in above ambition and ask for a data management plan, wherein the researcher demonstrates that the data to be collected, will be available for reuse in the future.

The policy is based on the following documents:

The Research Code of UMC Utrecht
Privacy Regulations of UMC Utrecht
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act
The Handbook for Adequate Natural Datastewardship (HANDS), prepared by the Dutch Federation of University medical centers (NFU)."""^^xsd:string .

As an organisation which creates and uses knowledge to make a difference, the University of Aberdeen wishes to make its research outputs (publications and the underlying research data) as freely available as possible, with the minimum of delay.  At the same time, we ensure that we meet all legislative and ethical obligations to protect the rights and privacy of individuals and minimize the potential for harm. We comply with UKRI‚Äôs Common Principles on Data Policy and the Concordat on Open Research Data.0F1

Managing and sharing research data effectively is fundamental to facilitating high quality research practice, supporting our commitment to research excellence and good research governance.

The University outlines below the main principles of the policy for the appropriate management and sharing of all research data1F2 that is generated as a result of University research activity, throughout the life of the project and beyond, to ensure that researchers comply with legislative, funding body, data owner, and internal policy and audit requirements, and that, where appropriate, the data remains discoverable, available and usable over time, for future validation, access and re-use.

The University aims to support the open research agenda for both data and publications to make data more accessible to researchers and to share resources across institutions in order to create impact, recognition, curation, and influence, and ensure longevity and visibility.

## Scope

The policy applies to all staff that are authorised to use the University‚Äôs name and services in the course of their research, including postgraduate students and visiting, honorary, and emeritus staff.  It also applies to staff supervising student research projects. University use of NHS and clinical data is subject to additional governance.

## Research Data Management Policy

### Purpose

This policy aims to ensure that our research data management practices meet the highest standards and are aligned with the UKRI Research Council Common Principles on Data Policy1, and the Concordat on Open Research Data.2 It sets out the University‚Äôs expectations so that all stakeholders recognise their responsibilities and obligations and can contribute to data being maintained and preserved as identifiable, discoverable, retrievable and reusable assets.

### Scope

This policy is binding on all University members engaged in research, including staff and research students, and those who are conducting research on behalf of the University. The Policy does not apply to postgraduate taught and undergraduate students, except where their research findings are included in published research outputs.

### Implementation

An evolutionary approach will be taken to implementing this policy with a target date of 2022 set for full implementation. A research data roadmap will help the University achieve this goal and progress will be reviewed regularly. Initially, priority will be given to ensuring funder requirements are met and/or to research where the results have potential for publication. For funded projects, the requirements of this policy are mandatory from the date of this policy onwards.

The University expects all research data with potential long-term value will eventually be managed to the same standards, but recognises that extending the scope of this policy beyond those engaged in funded research will be a longer-term endeavour.

In light of the pace of change in this field, this policy will be reviewed 12-months from the date of approval.

The HRA's scope includes all methodled research on physical and mental illnesses in humans and on the structure and function of the human body, with the aim of gaining generalizable knowledge.

Use of (coded) patient samples or data for research purposes is only permitted if written consent has been obtained (General or Informed Consent, respectively). The signed consent and a potential electronic Informed Consent (eIC) should be collected and stored separately from the coded sample/data, to avoid person identification.

Research projects that do not fall within the scope of the HRA do not need permission from the cantonal ethics committee but are required to get legal authorization before an experiment can be conducted (e.g., animal studies). Depending on the project and institution, special provisions may apply for obtaining authorizations (Annex A8).

All researchers should familiarise themselves with and comply with GDPR and DPA regulations on data sharing.

Data that has been selected for retention should not be deposited with any organisation that does not commit to its access and availability for reuse unless this is a condition of funding or would prevent commercial interests.

All digital research data that has been selected by the Data Steward or research group for retention should be deposited in the UCLan data repository or a suitable national or international data service or subject repository within 12 months of generation.  As a minimum, where a dataset underpins published research, every effort must be made to ensure its availability on open access at the date of publication or before.

Research data that has been selected for retention should be registered with UCLan‚Äôs data repository, even where the data has been deposited in an external repository or if the data is not suitable for open access.  Datasets can be registered by creating a metadata-only record which must contain a stable link, preferably a digital object identifier (DOI) to the externally-held data, where applicable.

Funders typically regard non-deposit of research data as an exception therefore researchers should make every effort throughout the project to ensure data can be shared openly.  Legitimate reasons for non-deposit of data include ethical, legal and commercial constraints; where feasible, issues preventing data sharing should be identified prior to data generation.

The funder should always be made aware of any constraints on access and researchers must be prepared to provide evidence justifying non-deposit.  Where the risk has a limited time span, researchers should ensure a publication plan is in place.  Data that is withheld or temporarily embargoed should still be managed and held in a format that would permit sharing in event of, for example, a Freedom of Information request or random audit by a funder.

If the research data are to be deleted or destroyed, for example because its agreed period of retention has expired or due to ethical or legal reasons, this should be done so in accordance with all legal, ethical, research funder and collaborator requirements, and with particular concern for confidentiality and security. Any action taken should be documented and retrievable, for possible future audit."""^^xsd:string .

As an institution, UCLan fully supports open research and open practice.  Research data generated at the University is recognised as an institutional asset that when shared openly not only increases the visibility of UCLan‚Äôs research but also facilitates public engagement and creates new opportunities for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

In order to be made open access, research data must be created and managed with sharing in mind at every stage of the research process, from planning to publication.

This research data management policy clarifies the University‚Äôs expectations concerning the management, storage, publication and sharing of research data. This Policy reflects the University‚Äôs intention to establish good research data management practice throughout the research lifecycle as part of the institution‚Äôs commitment to research excellence.

Research data management is a collective term for the planning, collection, storage, sharing and preservation of research data, and it therefore covers the entire research data lifecycle (Figure 1). Good management of research data contributes to improved efficiency and transparency of research processes, and to increased reliability and reproducibility of research results. Thorough planning can ensure compliance with legislation, promote a clear division of responsibilities between collaborators, and safeguard secure storage and handling of data to prevent loss or misuse. For the individual researcher, good data management can lead to improved visibility and impact of their research, for example by facilitating the reuse of their data sets by others.

Where possible, research data should be accompanied by rich metadata using standardised vocabularies and should be stored in standard formats in order to increase their interoperability. If there is an exchange of personal data with a¬†third party where the University is the data exporter, an agreement must be drawn up to ensure the data are protected.  

When conducting research involving external partners, researchers are advised to draw up an agreement that specifies rights and responsibilities of the involved parties, regarding, for example, intellectual property rights and licensing, or responsibilities in relation to research data management.  

Researchers are advised to prepare a¬†data management plan for their research projects to ensure the data are complete, accurate, reliable, and secure. Data management plans should be updated regularly to reflect what actually happened with the data."""^^xsd:string .

Research data that serve as a¬†basis for a¬†publication are to be retained for a¬†period of minimum 10 years since the day the research results are published, so that the results may be verified. If it is necessary to delete some data earlier, for example due to contractual obligations, this information is to be provided in the documentation. Researchers are encouraged to retain their research data for as long as feasible.

Research data should be made available for access and reuse as widely as feasible, in accordance with the principle ‚Äúas open as possible, as closed as necessary‚Äù. When researchers share their data, they should adhere to the following principles.  

Research data are to be shared along with rich metadata to provide sufficient   
information on their provenance and to increase their findability and reusability.   
Metadata of shared data include references, via persistent identifiers, to other related outputs and entities.   
Research data should be assigned a¬†persistent identifier.   
Research data should be shared via a¬†trusted repository or a¬†suitable platform that is established within the research field.   
In compliance with intellectual property rights, research data should be assigned an appropriate license in order to clearly specify the conditions for reuse, unless funder requirements, statutory or contractual obligations provide otherwise. It is recommended to use open licenses such as Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY).   
Where appropriate, published research should include a¬†data availability statement  

which outlines how the underlying data may be accessed."""^^xsd:string .
