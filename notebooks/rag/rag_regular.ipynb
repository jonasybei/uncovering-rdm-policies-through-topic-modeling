      "research projects will generally formally conclude upon their financial-administrative completion. n explanation of the criteria that are used: Findable The data must be findable for other researchers and involved parties. Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it. Reusable This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 7. Long-term retention This criterion is further elaborated upon in Article 8.

Its findability improves if it is deposited in a (discipline-specific) data archive or repository. The information about the data (metadata) is then registered in a standardised manner and is findable, also for search engines. Future findability is guaranteed by assigning a persistent identifier to the data. A commonly used identifier for data is DOI (digital object identifier). A DOI is assigned by a data archive or data publisher and is a unique number for a digital object, in this case a dataset. The DOI remains the same even if the location of the dataset (URL) changes. A DOI or other persistent identifier is used in citations or references to the dataset. Accessible: Data accessibility does not necessarily mean that the data must immediately be made fully open. The data will have to be made accessible in some instances, for example for verification by a grant provider or journal, but will remain inaccessible to the wider public. With sensitive data, full publication will never be an option. Research data can be retained under embargo; then only those who have deposited the data have access to it. The duration of the embargo is determined in consultation with the data archive. A further option is only to grant access if a request for access is submitted to the researcher. The researcher then knows who is consulting the data and can reach agreements about its use and reuse. NB: if the decision is made to limit access to the data, it is essential that the metadata (description of the data) is findable. Comprehensible Metadata and any supplementary documentation must describe the data in such a way that other researchers will also be able to understand and use it.
